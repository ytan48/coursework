For our analysis, we want to add a new column called `US_large_rank` that contains the ranking of large schools in the United States.  There are several ways to do this, but one of the easiest is to use the `reset_index()` function.\n",

    "- Since the list is already sorted, we know the first university in `df_US_large` is the top university (Rank #1).  The second row is Rank #2, and so on.\n",
