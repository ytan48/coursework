0,"Why is every book I hear about a "" NY Times # 1 Best Seller "" ? ELI5 : Why is every book I hear about a "" NY Times # 1 Best Seller "" ? Should n't there only be one "" # 1 "" best seller ? Please explain like I'm five.","Basically there are many categories of "" Best Seller "" . Replace "" Best Seller "" by something like "" Oscars "" and every "" best seller "" book is basically an "" oscar - winning "" book . May not have won the "" Best film "" , but even if you won the best director or best script , you 're still an "" oscar - winning "" film . Same thing for best sellers . Also , IIRC the rankings change every week or something like that . Some you might not be best seller one week , but you may be the next week . I guess even if you do n't stay there for long , you still achieved the status . Hence , # 1 best seller .","There are many different best seller lists that are published by various organizations, and the New York Times is just one of them. The New York Times best seller list is a weekly list that ranks the best-selling books in the United States based on sales data from a number of different retailers. The list is published in the New York Times newspaper and is widely considered to be one of the most influential best seller lists in the book industry. 
It's important to note that the New York Times best seller list is not the only best seller list out there, and there are many other lists that rank the top-selling books in different categories or in different countries. So it's possible that a book could be a best seller on one list but not on another. 
Additionally, the term ""best seller"" is often used more broadly to refer to any book that is selling well, regardless of whether it is on a specific best seller list or not. So it's possible that you may hear about a book being a ""best seller"" even if it is not specifically ranked as a number one best seller on the New York Times list or any other list."
1,"If salt is so bad for cars , why do we use it on the roads ? As the title states , why do we use it ? is there no other option or what ? Please explain like I'm five.","salt is good for not dying in car crashes and car crashes are worse for cars then salt . Some places use other things , but salt is really cheap compared to most alternatives , although sand is pretty good .","Salt is used on roads to help melt ice and snow and improve traction during the winter months. When it's cold outside, water can freeze on the roads and make them very slippery, which can be dangerous for cars and people. Salt helps to melt the ice and snow by lowering the freezing point of water, which means that it can help keep the roads clear and safe to travel on. 
There are other options for melting ice and snow on roads, such as using chemicals like calcium chloride or magnesium chloride, or using mechanical methods like plows or sand. However, salt is often the most effective and affordable option for many communities, especially when it's used in combination with other methods. 
It's important to note that while salt can be helpful for making roads safer during the winter, it can also have negative effects on the environment and on the cars themselves. Salt can cause corrosion on metal surfaces, including cars, and it can also harm plants and animals if it washes into nearby waterways. However, despite these potential downsides, many communities continue to use salt as a way to keep roads clear and safe during the winter."
2,Why do we still have SD TV channels when HD looks like SD on an old TV ? Could n't we just have the HD version of the channels & delete the SD ones ? Please explain like I'm five.,"The way it works is that old TV stations got a certain amount of bandwidth to replace their old analog TV stations . However , HD takes up more bandwidth then SD - so the stations can choose between 2 or 3 HD stations , or like 7 or 8 SD stations ( or a mix of both ) They can do a bunch of SD stations and make more money in advertizing by running 7 or 8 different reruns of old SD TV shows at a time In fact , those stations often got permanent rights to show an unlimited number of reruns of old syndicated shows in perpetuity . That means they do n't even have to pay anyone to air old eppisodes of _ Star Trek _ or _ Alf _ So basically it 's free money for them , based on being around for a long , long time and having their old rights get upgraded as new technology comes out .","There are a few reasons why we still have SD (standard definition) TV channels: 
1. Some people still use older TVs that are not compatible with HD (high definition) signals. These TVs can only display SD channels, so if we only had HD channels, those people wouldn't be able to watch TV. 
2. HD channels take up more bandwidth than SD channels, so it's not possible to have as many HD channels as we have SD channels. This means that if we only had HD channels, some channels might not be available. 
3. HD channels also require more expensive equipment to produce, so some TV stations might not be able to afford to upgrade to HD. 
Overall, it's important to have both SD and HD channels so that everyone can watch TV, regardless of what kind of TV they have or how much money they have."
3,Why has nobody assassinated Kim Jong - un He is such a pest and nuisance to basically the entire world except for China . Why has n't anyone had him assassinated yet ? Please explain like I'm five.,"You ca n't just go around assassinating the leaders of countries you do nt like ! The international condemnation would be brutal . Even though noone likes Kim Jong - Un , and everyone thinks North Korea is pretty shitty to its citizens , if say the US were to send agents over ( and do n't think they are n't capable of it ) and they got caught .... every country , every world leader would be a potential target . Who 's next ... Castro ? Angela Merkel ? Anyways , rumour has it that he 's ultra paranoid about exactly that and travels around in tanks and armoured trains that make Limo 1 look like a tonka toy .","It is generally not acceptable or ethical to advocate for or condone the assassination of any individual, regardless of their actions or beliefs. There are also practical considerations at play in this situation. 
First and foremost, it is important to remember that assassination is a violent and extreme act that can have serious consequences, both for the person being targeted and for those around them. It can also lead to further conflict and instability in the region. 
Additionally, the North Korean government is known for being highly secretive and heavily guarded, making it difficult for outsiders to carry out such an action. There may also be legal and diplomatic implications for any country or individual that attempts to assassinate the leader of another sovereign state. 
It is important to seek peaceful and diplomatic solutions to conflicts and differences, rather than resorting to violence and assassination."
4,How was airplane technology able to advance so quickly after the Wright Brothers ' first flight ? Mainly interested in how aviation was able to be deployed on a large scale during WWI . Please explain like I'm five.,Wanting to kill the shit out of Germans drives innovation .,"After the Wright Brothers made the first powered flight in 1903, people all around the world became interested in building and flying airplanes. Many people started working on designing and building airplanes, and as a result, airplane technology began to advance quickly. 
One reason for this rapid advancement was the fact that airplanes were very useful for a number of different purposes. For example, airplanes were used for transportation, for carrying mail, for crop dusting, and for military purposes. This meant that there was a lot of demand for airplanes, which in turn encouraged more people to work on developing and improving airplane technology. 
During World War I, airplanes became even more important because they were used for fighting in the war. This led to even more rapid development of airplane technology as people tried to build airplanes that were faster, more maneuverable, and more durable. 
So, in short, the reason that airplane technology was able to advance so quickly was because there was a lot of interest in airplanes and a lot of people working on developing and improving them. This was especially true during World War I, when the need for effective military airplanes was particularly pressing."
5,Why do humans have different colored eyes ? What causes / caused people to have different colors of eyes ? Is there a point to the color of your eyes other than superstitions ? Please explain like I'm five.,"Melanin ! Many of the the first known humans existed in the fertile crescent - modern day Iraq and surrounding areas , and it was just as sunny and hot as it is today . Melanin causes skin and eyes to have a darker color , and as a benefit reduced the amount of UV radiation absorbed into the skin . Eventually humans expanded into less hot and sunlit areas allowing for the survival and procreation of people who developed lighter colored eyes and skin because of the lack of need of melanin for survival .","The color of your eyes is determined by the amount and type of pigments in your iris, which is the colored part of your eye, and by the way that the iris scatters light. The iris contains two types of pigment: one called melanin, which gives your skin, hair, and eyes their color, and another called lipochrome, which is a yellowish pigment. The combination of these pigments, along with the structure of the iris, determines the color of your eyes. 
There are many different shades of eye color, ranging from dark brown to light blue, and the most common eye colors are brown, blue, and green. The color of your eyes is determined by your genes, which are the instructions that you inherit from your parents that tell your body how to grow and function. 
There is no scientific evidence to suggest that the color of your eyes has any special meaning or significance. However, many people believe that the color of your eyes can reveal certain things about your personality or your health, but these beliefs are not supported by scientific evidence. 
In short, the color of your eyes is simply a result of the combination of pigments and the way that light is scattered by your iris, and it has no special meaning or significance."
6,"Why I can not fabricate a religion that prevents me from going to school , then cite my first amendment rights when I am charged ? Prevents me from going to school by having , for example , supposed prayer times that coincide with school hours . Thanks ! Please explain like I'm five.","Because you 're a minor and your parents get to make that choice for you . Specifically to keep you from doing dumb shit like this . Now go to bed , you are going to school tomorrow .","The First Amendment to the United States Constitution protects the freedom of religion, which means that you have the right to believe and practice whatever religion you choose. However, this freedom is not absolute and can be limited in certain circumstances to protect the rights and safety of others. 
In the case you described, going to school is not a matter of personal belief or religious practice. It is a legal requirement for children of a certain age to attend school in order to receive an education. By not going to school, you would be breaking the law and could be charged for truancy or failing to comply with compulsory education laws. 
Even if you tried to claim that your religion prevents you from going to school, the government has the right to regulate certain activities that could interfere with the education of children or the functioning of schools. The government has a compelling interest in ensuring that children receive a proper education, and the First Amendment does not protect actions that would disrupt or interfere with this important goal. 
So, while you have the right to freely practice your religion, you still have to follow the laws and regulations that apply to everyone else, including those related to education."
7,"What has changed that we frequently now throw away products instead of fixing them ? Is it the quality or nature of the products themselves , or more cultural in origin ? Please explain like I'm five.","It 's three fold : * Stuff is cheaper to mass produce now then it used to be , making it easy to replace something * Fixing something that 's broken is almost always not a mass - production task . It require human time and effort and unique problem solving skills depending on the issue . This has always been expensive , and is still expensive today . * Many things today are completely impossible for the average person to fix , often not due to people trying to prevent it , but because things are so complicated today , that it 's nearly impossible to be able to fix all the kinds of things you use , compared to 200 years ago when you only used a small set of tools and items which were all relatively simple .","There are a few different factors that can contribute to the trend of throwing away products instead of fixing them. One factor is the quality of the products themselves. Some products are designed in a way that makes them difficult or impossible to repair. For example, if a product is made with very cheap materials or is put together in a way that makes it hard to access the parts that need to be repaired, it may be easier or cheaper to just throw it away and buy a new one rather than try to fix it. 
Another factor is cultural in origin. In some societies, it is more common or acceptable to throw away things that are broken or no longer wanted, rather than trying to repair them or give them to someone else who might be able to use them. This can be influenced by things like the availability of cheap, new products and the convenience of being able to just buy a new item instead of trying to fix the old one. 
Finally, in some cases, the cost of repairing a product might be more expensive than buying a new one. This can happen if the product is very old or if the parts needed to fix it are hard to find or very expensive. In these cases, it might make more sense to just buy a new product instead of trying to repair the old one."
8,"magic the gathering What is it . how popular is it . who plays it . The culture behind it .. etc . etc I have been hearing more and more about it , and after last nights South Park episode I became curious what it is .. Please explain like I'm five.","EDIT , Nov 21 : By popular demand , now includes Midrange decks and Limited formats . Also , a new section on where players get their cards . Magic : The Gathering is a collectable card game . It can be played in several different formats , but in the most common , two players create decks out of the cards they own and play against each other . Generally , the cards in a deck are either lands or spells . Lands provide the energy needed to cast spells , and spells usually do one of the following : - Summon a creature that can fight for you or an artifact that you can use . ( * * Creatures * * and * * Artifacts * * ) - Create a lasting effect that affects the game as a whole or one or more cards in play . ( * * Enchantments * * ) - Create an instantaneous effect that affects one or more cards in play or an effect that lasts a single turn . ( * * Sorceries * * and * * Instants * * ) - Summon a sort of "" teammate "" that has its own abilities . ( * * Planeswalkers * * ) The primary goal is to run your opponent out of life points by attacking him with creatures or damaging him directly with spells . There are other ways to win , such as running your opponent out of cards in his deck . The gameplay is complex . The players take turns , but many types of spells can be cast on an opponent 's turn , or in response to a spell that they are trying to cast . A critical play by one player may be countered by the other , and that counter itself countered by the first . There are many thousands of cards out there , and you are not expected to know about them all . The Comprehensive Rules ( * not * including the text of cards ) are nearly two hundred pages , although a lot of that consists of old mechanics that are rarely used or highly - specified details that are rarely relevant . The learning curve is pretty steep , but a few games suffice to learn the basic rules . The complexity is more similar to Dungeons and Dragons than to most card games . A key feature of M : tG is the concept of * * color * * . There are five colors : Red , Green , White , Blue , Black . Each is "" allied "" to two others and "" opposed "" to the two others . Most spells require mana of a certain color to cast , which is produced by different types of land cards . Each color has distinct strengths and weaknesses – for example , blue has the best counterspells , but it 's not very good at simply hitting things . A given deck will usually use from one to three colors of card , although in some situations decks with four or five colors can work . In addition , it is often considered that there are three general archetypes of deck ( with a * lot * of variation within each category ) : - * * Aggro * * decks focus on dealing damage ASAP to win ASAP . They usually have cheap creatures ( "" weenies "" ) that can be used right away and "" buff""-type spells to eke out a few more points of damage . They usually win fast or not at all , because they often ca n't stand up to the more powerful creatures and spells that are played later in the game . - * * Control * * decks focus on preventing the opponent from acting until the player is ready to win with powerful spells or abilities . They run a lot of counterspells , destruction spells , and things that make action more expensive for the opponent , along with a few creatures strong on defense and disruption . They usually win by using cheap defenses against expensive attacks until they are ready to overwhelm the opponent with their accumulated strength , and lose if they just ca n't stay ahead of the enemy 's attacks . - * * Combo * * decks rely on a few combinations of cards that can lead to a near - instant victory . There * are * infinite combos in M : tG , but they 're designed to be difficult or resource - intensive to pull off . A combo deck will usually run ( in addition to the all - important combo pieces ) "" tutor "" cards that let them search their deck , protection cards to guard the combo pieces , and just enough stall cards to prevent a quick defeat . A combo deck wins when it gets its combo in place before losing , and loses if it ca n't get the combo out in time or ca n't protect it long enough to use it . - * * Midrange * * decks are a common intermediate archetype between Aggro and Control . Midrange tries to beat down the opponent with damage from powerful creatures ( colloquially , "" fatties "" ) rather than with cheap ones ( "" weenies "" ) . These decks have to run enough control to stay alive until the big hitters come out . They win when they get the hitters out early enough to do lethal damage , and lose when they ca n't get the big guys out at all ( being out - controlled ) or when they just take too much of a beating too early ( being out - aggro'd ) . --- Many different kinds of people play M : tG. There are professional players who win large sums at tournaments , groups of friends who play casually on the weekends , and everything in between . If you 're playing competitively , it can be absurdly expensive , as you can not compromise on getting the perfect cards for your deck , but if you and your opponents are playing casually , it 's a lot cheaper . The most common formats are as follows . Two - player games are the norm for tournaments , but casual matches are often multiplayer . * * Constructed * * formats call for pre - constructed decks built from each player 's personal collection : - * * Standard * * : Decks are made of cards printed in about the last 18 months . - * * Modern * * : Decks are made of cards printed since about 2003 ( minus a ban list ) . - * * Legacy * * : Decks are made of * any * cards ( minus a ban list ) . - * * Vintage * * : Decks are made of * any * cards ( minus a * very small * ban list ) . - * * Commander * * ( or "" EDH "" ): Decks are made of * any * cards ( minus a ban list ) , but limited to one of each card . One creature card is designated as your "" commander "" and is nearly always available for summoning . A popular multiplayer format . * * Limited * * formats feature decks made on the spot from a limited pool of cards : - * * Sealed * * : Each player opens several randomized booster packs and makes a deck from the contents . - * * Draft * * : A group of players open many packs and use a system to pick their cards from the contents , then build a deck from what they have . These formats cost money each time to play , because you need to buy booster packs . However , you can play them without having any of your own cards beforehand . Limited play can be a good way to pick up more cards . A relatively new casual format is * * Cube * * , in which you and your group put together a large pile of cards beforehand and use them in place of booster packs . This eliminates the recurring expense , although you need to have enough cards beforehand . There are others formats , including Conspiracy , Planechase , Pauper ( use no rare cards ) . Two - Headed Giant ( play with a partner ) , and many more . Formats that allow older cards tend to be more expensive , because the cards have been out of print for a long time . Commander is a bit cheaper than other formats that allow old cards , because you only can have one of each card ( other formats usually allow up to four of each card ) . I play Commander with my D & D group . None of us puts that much money into it , and we try to keep it more fun than competitive . Some of the players also play in local mini - tournaments on Friday nights ( "" Friday Night Magic "" ) , usually breaking about even . --- So , where does one get cards ? Most cards come from randomized booster packs with 15 cards each . Cards from a given set are designated either common , uncommon , rare , or "" mythic rare "" . You can buy booster packs for around $ 3.50 USD from retailers , or you can buy them as part of a limited tournament . There are also pre - made decks that you can buy directly from Wizards of the Coast . Each one has a theme and cards intended to work together . You wo n't win any tournaments with a pre - made deck , but it can be a good starting point . In addition , there are a couple of products intended for beginners , such as the "" Deck - builder 's toolkit "" with a semi - randomized selection of cards and a big stack of common lands . ( Common lands are dirt cheap , but it would take quite a few booster packs to get enough to build a deck . ) Most M : tG players trade cards with their friends or at events to get the specific cards they need . In addition , there is a thriving market of single cards at game stores and online . Some very , very old cards are very , very rare and expensive . A single [ Black Lotus ] ( URL_0 ) can cost many thousands of dollars . But these cards are not legal in most formats , and most players will never have seen one in person . When playing casually , your group may allow the use of "" proxy "" cards to substitute for the pricey ones . Myself , I 've only been playing for a year or so , and I do n't actually own my own cards ! ( My friends have a ton of extra decks to lend out . ) I 'm planning to build my own Commander deck soon , and I 'll be starting from a pre - made deck from Wizards and supplementing it primarily with trades with friends and singles from the internet .","Magic: The Gathering is a collectible card game that was first published in 1993. It is played by millions of people around the world, and has a very dedicated and passionate player base.

9,What are prions and are they a big deal ? My AP Biology teacher mentioned them alongside viruses but he did n't say much else beyond that they are n't viruses and they deform protein structure . Please explain like I'm five.,"Like viruses , they are ( groups of ) molecules that reproduce without metabolism . Unlike any other self - replicating system , prions are proteins that have a unique structure . One part of how a protein functions is the amino acid sequence that makes up the primary structure , but the other part is how the proteins folds , either by itself or with the help of other folder - helper proteins . Prions have the same amino acid sequence as their properly folded brethren , but they are folded differently , and they make a chain reaction by folding their brethren to be like them . Cruetzfeld - Jakob disease in humans , Mad Cow disease in cows , and chronic wasting disease in deer , are all prion diseases that affect neuronal proteins .","Prions are tiny particles that can cause serious and often fatal diseases in people and animals. They are made up of proteins, which are important building blocks in the body. Normally, proteins have a specific shape that helps them do their job. But prions are abnormal proteins that have a different shape, and they can cause other proteins around them to change shape too. When this happens, it can cause problems in the body because the proteins are not able to work properly. 
Prions are not viruses, and they do not contain any genetic material (like DNA or RNA) like viruses do. Instead, they are thought to be able to change the shape of proteins by acting as a kind of template for other proteins to copy. 
Prion diseases can be very serious and are often fatal. Some examples of prion diseases include Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) in humans, and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, also known as ""mad cow disease"") in cows. These diseases can be transmitted through contaminated food or medical equipment, but they can also occur spontaneously in some people. 
There is currently no cure for prion diseases, and they can be difficult to diagnose. Researchers are working to better understand how prions cause disease and to find ways to prevent and treat these conditions."
10,What is a hacker really doing ? I 've always wanted to know why hackers are jamming on their keyboards and what they can possibly be doing that requires such precision and speed . Please explain like I'm five.,"> I 've always wanted to know why hackers are jamming on their keyboards In reality , this does n't happen . This is done in movies to make it look dramatic and exciting . Real computer hacking involves staring at a computer screen for hours of a time , searching a lot on Google , muttering "" hmmm "" and various expletives to oneself now and then , and stroking one 's hacker - beard while occasionally tapping on a few keys .","A hacker is someone who uses their computer skills to try to gain access to systems or networks without permission. Hackers might do this for a variety of reasons, such as to steal information, to cause damage or disruption, or just for the challenge of it. 
Hacking can involve a lot of typing and computer use, because hackers often use special software and programs to try to find weaknesses in a system or network. They might also use tools to try to guess passwords or to find ways to get around security measures. This can involve a lot of trial and error, which is why hackers might seem to be ""jamming on their keyboards"" as they try different approaches. 
Overall, hacking can be a complex and technical activity that requires a lot of knowledge and skill. Hackers might use a wide range of techniques and tools to try to achieve their goals, and they might spend a lot of time researching and testing different approaches to find a way in."
11,How does depression work in the brain ? And is it more physical of psychological ? ( Both cause and symptoms ) Please explain like I'm five.,"As someone who suffers from severe depression I can tell you mine is both physical and psychological . I know in my heart that no matter what circumstances I could ever be subjected to would never change that or get rid of it , it would be more of a genetics thing I suppose . Lately I tried to explain it to a friend and the only thing I can really use as an analogy for me are paper towels . Some are produced cheap and are shit , they tear and do n't soak up shit . These paper towels are still trying to be good but poor genes have them already behind a better crafted towel . Now let 's pretend we have two hammocks with one being designed using the shitty paper towel and one using the really strong and absorbent towel . If you consider each one of life 's problems and also just poor genes as a marble and you were to drop a marble into the hammocks they would eventually fall thru and you would be screwed . I view talking and medicine as a removal of a marble or two and at the end of the day I suppose each person develops ways of removing marbles but the marbles do n't stop coming . This whole life is just a flimsy , soaked towel and I lost my marbles .","Depression is a medical condition that affects the way you feel. It can be caused by a combination of physical, psychological, and environmental factors. 
In the brain, depression is thought to be caused by an imbalance of certain chemicals called neurotransmitters. These chemicals help transmit messages between nerve cells in the brain. When there is an imbalance of neurotransmitters, it can affect your mood and behavior. 
Symptoms of depression can be both physical and psychological. Physical symptoms may include changes in appetite and sleep patterns, fatigue, and body aches. Psychological symptoms may include feeling sad or hopeless, losing interest in activities you used to enjoy, and difficulty concentrating. 
It's important to note that everyone experiences depression differently, and treatment may involve a combination of therapy, medication, and lifestyle changes. If you think you or someone you know may be experiencing depression, it's important to speak with a healthcare provider for a proper evaluation and treatment plan."
12,Why do movie companies build sets rather than film on scene ? Seems like any location will do and seems like it 's cheaper to find an existing location rather than building their own . But I 'm open to being wrong . Please explain like I'm five.,"Most of the time , any location wo nt do . They want a specific look , so they build a set to fit that look . Or there s nothing like it nearby , and it 's cheaper than paying everyone to live somewhere else for the length of the shoot . Also , many public places simply ca n't be close off that long . If you 're filming a movie over the course of a year , you might be able to shut down an area for a few days of shooting , but if you need that space often you 're not going to be able to shut down a park or roads every few days . Also , if you 're filming in a public area it 's hard to stop the public from wandering in or watching from as close as possible . also , they can build the set without certain walls or in certain ways so camera angles that are n't possible in real places you can suddenly do . And if you have to destroy something ..... or have something loud and noisy or distracting ...","There are a few reasons why movie companies might choose to build sets rather than film on location: 
1. Control: Building a set allows the filmmakers to have complete control over the look and feel of the environment in which they are shooting. This can be especially important if the story takes place in a fantastical or fictional world, or if the filmmakers want to create a specific mood or atmosphere. 
2. Cost: While it may seem like it would be cheaper to film on location, this is not always the case. Renting a location can be expensive, especially if the filmmakers need to use it for an extended period of time. Additionally, the filmmakers may need to pay to use certain locations, or they may have to pay to have the location altered in some way to suit their needs. 
3. Logistics: Filming on location can also be logistically challenging. The filmmakers may need to deal with crowds, noise, and other distractions, which can make it difficult to get the shots they need. Additionally, the filmmakers may not have access to all of the resources they need on location, such as electricity, water, or special equipment. 
4. Safety: Finally, building a set can be safer for the cast and crew. Filming on location can involve dealing with hazards such as traffic, unstable terrain, or inclement weather. By building a set, the filmmakers can create a controlled environment where these hazards are minimized. 
Overall, building sets can be more expensive upfront, but it can also be more cost-effective in the long run, as it allows the filmmakers to have greater control over their shooting environment and reduce the risk of delays or unexpected costs."
13,"What is a "" Tor exit node "" or "" Tor node "" What is a "" Tor exit node "" or "" Tor node "" ? Please explain like I'm five.","I 'm going to go off the assumption that you do n't know what tor is , if you do then feel free to skip the next paragraph . The entire idea behind tor is that by bouncing your information through different relay points , each of which is secured and the data transfers between them are encrypted , thus making your communications much harder to trace back to you . If I turn on my computer and use a regular browser , lets say Firefox , my computer requests that a specific bit of information from , lets say , reddit . My request is sent from my computer , to my ISP 's servers , to the servers of the website and then takes the little bit of information , lets say a specific webpage , and then does that same process in reverse . Taking the information from the servers of the website to the ISP 's servers and then back to my computer . Tor complicates this process by , rather then doing a straight line of data from computer to ISP to site , first encrypting all the communication and then secondly bouncing that signal / request for data around before submitting the request for information . This has the effect of making you appear like your in another place and posses a different IP address then you actually do . Simply put , a Tor node is one of the small parts of the jump that obfuscates your physical location and IP address by bouncing your information . An exit node is a tor node that serves as the ' exit ' point from the tor network and sends the actual request for information from the site . Hopefully that clears this up , if you have anymore questions just ask . :)","A Tor node is a computer that is part of the Tor network. The Tor network is a group of computers that work together to provide anonymity to internet users. When you use the Tor network, your internet traffic is routed through multiple Tor nodes before it reaches its final destination. 
A Tor exit node is a special type of Tor node that is the last stop for your internet traffic before it reaches its final destination. When you use the Tor network to access a website, your traffic is encrypted and routed through multiple Tor nodes before it reaches the exit node. The exit node then decrypts your traffic and sends it on to the website you are trying to access. 
The purpose of the Tor network is to provide anonymity to internet users by routing their traffic through multiple nodes and encrypting it. This makes it difficult for anyone to track your online activity or figure out where you are located."
14,How does DRM work ? Digital Rights Management . The wikipedia page goes off in many directions . First hit my radar with the Xbox One stuff . How does DRM work and why is it so controversial ? Thank you ! Please explain like I'm five.,"The reason wikipedia goes off in many directions is because it 's a generic term , it does n't describe any single technique . It 's just attempting to get people to pay you for their thing , preventing them from pirating it . It 's controversial because a lot of DRM implementations tend to be very inconvenient for the legit customers , whereas the people that would pirate your product will likely be able to do it anyway , and because their copy is cracked , they do n't see the downside of the restrictive DRM . It literally only hurts the paying customers , which in turn forces more people to pirate . Nobody wins .","Digital Rights Management (DRM) is a technology that is used to protect and control access to digital content, such as music, movies, ebooks, and software. It is often used by media companies, content creators, and publishers to prevent unauthorized copying and distribution of their content. 
There are many different ways that DRM can be implemented, but generally it works by encrypting the content and requiring users to authenticate themselves before they can access it. For example, if you want to play a song that has DRM on it, you may need to enter a special code or password in order to unlock it. 
DRM can be controversial because it can make it more difficult for people to use the content that they have purchased in the way that they want to. For example, if you buy a song from a store and it has DRM on it, you may not be able to play it on all of your devices, or you may have to jump through some hoops to get it to work. This can be frustrating for users, especially if they feel like they are paying for something that they can't fully use. 
There are also concerns about DRM being used to track users or limit their freedom to use the content in certain ways. Some people believe that DRM is unnecessary and that it does more harm than good, while others argue that it is necessary to protect the rights of content creators and prevent piracy."
15,Why are we forced to use banks to receive our income ? Obv not including illegal / off the books cash in hand work and that sort of thing .. Edit : It 's a pity people inside america are so stupid . Please explain like I'm five.,"You 're not . You can use a credit union , or take your check to a check - cashing store .","It is not necessary to use a bank to receive your income. There are other options available, such as receiving a check or direct deposit to a prepaid debit card or mobile payment app. However, using a bank can be a convenient and secure way to manage your money. 
Banks offer a number of financial services that can make it easier to manage your money, including the ability to deposit and withdraw cash, pay bills online, transfer money to other accounts, and earn interest on your savings. They also provide a safe place to store your money and protect it from theft or loss. 
Using a bank can also make it easier to keep track of your financial transactions and budget your money. Many banks offer online and mobile banking tools that allow you to view your account balances, track your spending, and set up alerts to help you stay on top of your finances. 
Overall, using a bank can provide a number of benefits and make it easier to manage your money. However, it is not required and there are other options available if you prefer not to use a bank."
16,Why can does bark what seems like forever but people can only scream for a hour or two ? I mean some dogs wo n't shut up and constantly yap . Please explain like I'm five.,"Because don'ts ca nt bark like never , so people seems like screaming less for some time .","Dogs bark for a variety of reasons, such as to alert their owners of something, to communicate with other dogs, or to express excitement or frustration. Some dogs are more prone to barking than others, and some breeds are known for being more vocal than others. 
People can only scream for a short period of time because our bodies are not built to handle the strain of screaming for long periods of time. Screaming uses a lot of energy and can be very tiring, which is why people can only do it for a short period of time before they need to rest. 
Dogs, on the other hand, are built differently and are able to bark for longer periods of time without getting as tired. Dogs also have different vocal cords than humans, which may make it easier for them to bark for longer periods of time without damaging their vocal cords."
17,What will happen to the United States economy as our debt increases and we continue to ignore it ? Will we eventually have to pay it off ? What if we do n't ? Please explain like I'm five.,"> Will we eventually have to pay it off ? What if we do n't ? Sorta , this "" debt "" is not the same as household debt . There are a handful of amazing ELI5s to help explain that part . ... Right now , economists do n't percieve the debt as much of an issue , we do n't know how much is "" too much debt "" but what is going on right now , they generally agree is the right move . Currently , for the US to take out debt , its incredibly cheap , so cheap that its overwhelmingly in the US 's best benefit to keep taking out debt . --eventually this wo n't be the case , but no one is really sure when that will be .","It's important for countries, just like people, to manage their debts responsibly. If a country has too much debt, it can be difficult for it to borrow money in the future and investors may be less likely to lend it money. This can make it harder for the country to fund things like infrastructure, education, and healthcare. 
If a country is not able to pay off its debts, it could default on its loans. This means that it would not be able to make the required payments to its lenders and could potentially lead to financial problems for the country. 
It's important for countries to try to pay off their debts, but it's not always possible to do it all at once. Instead, they might make a plan to gradually pay off their debts over time. This is called a debt repayment plan. 
In the case of the United States, the government has a lot of debt, but it also has a strong economy and is able to borrow money at low interest rates. This means that it can afford to pay back its debts over time. However, it's still important for the government to be careful about how much it borrows and to try to live within its means as much as possible."
18,Why are Republicans against giving the LGBT community equality ? I read an article about Democrats wanting to introduce a bill in Congress that would ban discrimination and the like targeted at the LGBT community . For what reasons would conservatives not be in support of this ? Please explain like I'm five.,"From a political perspective , a large voting block for the Republican party are older and very religiously conservative ( Usually Christian , specifically protestant ) . The more conservative forms of Christianity do not favor homosexuality . If the Republican party were to openly support protections for homosexuals ( and others that fall into LGBT categories ) they risk alienating an important voter block , which affects their reelection chances and political power .","It's important to note that not all Republicans are against giving the LGBT community equality. In fact, many Republicans support equal rights for the LGBT community. However, there are some conservatives who may not support equal rights for the LGBT community for a variety of reasons. 
One reason may be due to their religious beliefs. Some conservatives may believe that being gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgender goes against their interpretation of certain religious texts, and therefore they may oppose laws that would give these groups equal rights. 
Another reason may be due to a belief in traditional gender roles and sexual orientations. Some conservatives may believe that there are only two genders (male and female) and that people should only be attracted to members of the opposite sex. They may therefore oppose laws that would give equal rights to those who do not fit into these traditional gender roles or sexual orientations. 
It's also possible that some conservatives may simply not understand or agree with the experiences and perspectives of the LGBT community, and therefore may not support equal rights for them. 
Overall, it's important to remember that there are many different viewpoints on this issue, and that not everyone may agree on the best way to ensure equal rights for all people, including those in the LGBT community."
19,Why we experience the sensation of falling in our dreams / when we wake up Title basically says it all . What causes this sensation ? Why is it so seemingly universal and why is it so vivid relative to other physical sensations we experience in our dreams ? Please explain like I'm five.,"When you 're in between deep sleep and the lighter sleep where it 's easy to wake up , the sleep paralysis that stops you from acting out your dreams can do strange shit . Sometimes you 'll be surfacing to wakefulness again when your brain accidently throws the sleep paralysis switch again . The sudden tension in the body can feel like falling to a sleep - frazzled mind , and it galvanizes you strongly it can even create the sensation you 'd dropped onto the bed and bounced . You did n't . Your body just got switched into safe mode by accident .","The sensation of falling in dreams is actually a very common experience and can be caused by a variety of factors. One reason people may experience this sensation is due to changes in their body position while they are sleeping. When you are lying down, your body is in a state of relative stillness. However, if you move or shift positions while you are sleeping, your body may perceive this movement as falling. This can trigger a reflex that causes you to feel like you are falling or to experience a sensation of vertigo. 
Another reason people may experience the sensation of falling in their dreams is due to changes in their brain activity while they are sleeping. During the dreaming stage of sleep, known as rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, the brain is more active and may produce vivid and sometimes strange or surreal dreams. In some cases, the sensation of falling may be part of the dream content and may be related to the dreamer's feelings or emotions. 
Finally, the sensation of falling in dreams may be related to the way our brains process and interpret sensory information while we are asleep. During sleep, our brains are still receiving and processing sensory information from our surroundings, even though we are not consciously aware of it. This sensory information may be incorporated into our dreams and may contribute to the vividness and realism of the dream experience. 
Overall, the sensation of falling in dreams is a normal and common experience that is caused by a combination of factors related to body position, brain activity, and sensory processing during sleep."
20,Why do assassins in movies / games always hold their knives with the blade facing down and not up ? [ like this ] ( URL_0 ) Please explain like I'm five.,"holding the knife the traditional way gives good reach and finesse for fighting and holding the opponent at a distance . It is often a weaker grip , easier to disarm and harder to make powerful blows with . The goal of an assassin is almost always contrary to that goal . An assassin always wants a killing blow , which is more often a deep stab than a long distance slash . Finally , it looks cool . everyone holds a knife the normal way , so when you see someone holding it the other way , the assumption is they know what they 're doing and why they would want to hold it that way , which helps with the "" assassin "" portrayal . Here 's a good description of several grip types and the advantages URL_0","Holding a knife with the blade facing down is generally a more stable and secure grip, especially when the knife is being used for thrusting or stabbing motions. When the blade is facing up, it is more likely to slip out of the hand or be deflected by an opponent. In addition, holding a knife with the blade facing down allows the user to have better control over the blade and to apply more force when making a strike. 
Imagine that you are holding an apple in your hand and you want to cut it in half with a knife. If you hold the knife with the blade facing up, it might be more difficult to control the blade and keep it from slipping as you make the cut. On the other hand, if you hold the knife with the blade facing down, it will be easier to keep the blade steady and apply more force as you cut through the apple. 
In movies and games, assassins and other characters who use knives may hold them with the blade facing down for these same reasons. It allows them to have better control over the weapon and to make more precise and powerful strikes."
21,How come I can buy a carton of beer for $ 30 which has 24 glass bottles in it ... Yet if I buy 4 wine glasses ( which does n't even come with wine ) it costs over $ 30 ? ? . Please explain like I'm five.,"The quality of the glass is different , but more importantly the size of the prodction line , the ease with which you transport a case of beer compared to fragile goods like wine glasses , and you are missing intellectual property rights . Typically , all beer bottles look basically the same and no "" real "" cost has to be paid to designers . A designer can take a big percentage . Also , there are expensive beers , and cheap wine glasses . You wo n't pay that at IKEA .","There are a few reasons why a carton of beer might cost less than four wine glasses: 
1. Quantity: A carton of beer contains 24 bottles, while you are only buying four wine glasses. When you buy in larger quantities, the cost per unit (in this case, per bottle or per glass) is often lower. 
2. Materials: Wine glasses are typically made from materials like glass or crystal, which can be more expensive to produce than the materials used to make beer bottles (such as glass or aluminum). 
3. Brand: The specific brand of wine glasses and beer that you are comparing might also have an impact on the price. Some brands are known for using higher-quality materials or have a more premium image, which can result in higher prices. 
4. Production and distribution costs: The process of producing and distributing wine and beer also involves different costs. For example, the process of making wine involves fermenting grapes and aging the finished product, which can be more time-consuming and costly than the process of brewing beer. Additionally, wine is often shipped and stored at specific temperatures to preserve quality, which can also add to the overall cost. 
Overall, the price of a product is determined by a combination of factors, including the materials used, the brand, the quantity, and the costs involved in production and distribution."
22,Why the same products / brands have differents names in different countries ? for example : USA - Crest ; Europe - Blend - a - Med Feel free to give some more examples :) Please explain like I'm five.,"Sometimes it 's for legal reasons . For example , there was already a Burger King restaurant in Australia , so in order to avoid violating the other restaurant 's trademark , Burger King was re - branded as Hungry Jack 's ( which it 's still called in Australia today ) . Other times the name is changed because it historical / cultural meaning of the original name is lost across borders . For example , Harry Potter and the Philospher 's Stone was renamed Harry Potter and the Sorcerer 's Stone for US audiences because the mythology / story surrounding the Philospher 's Stone is not part of popular US culture / common knowledge , so the name lost it 's meaning in the US and Sorcerer 's Stone was seen to make more sense . Lastly , brand names are sometimes changed because the name may have a different meaning in another culture which ( potentially ) has a negative or inappropriate connotation . For example , the Honda Fit was originally going to be called the Honda Fitta until it was discovered that ' Fitta ' roughly translates to ' pussy ' in many Nordic languages . Another example is Church 's Chicken which has been re - branded as Texas Chicken in other parts of the world where ' Church ' is assumed to have a religious connection ( as opposed to just being a person 's name ) .","There are a few reasons why the same products or brands might have different names in different countries. One reason is that different countries often have different languages, and it can be easier for people to recognize and remember a brand name if it is written in their own language. For example, Crest is a brand of toothpaste that is popular in the United States, and Blend-a-Med is a brand of toothpaste that is popular in Europe. Both brands make toothpaste, but they have different names because they are marketed to people who speak different languages. 
Another reason why products might have different names in different countries is because different countries have different regulations about what can be sold and how it can be marketed. For example, some countries have laws that require products to have certain types of labels or warning messages, or that prohibit certain types of advertising. In order to comply with these laws, companies might need to use different names for their products in different countries. 
Finally, some companies simply choose to use different names for their products in different countries in order to appeal to different markets. For example, a company might use a more traditional or classic name for its products in one country, and a more modern or trendy name in another country, in order to better match the preferences of consumers in those markets."
23,"How do forensic psychologists create such specific criminal profiles ? Such as the make , model and color of the car the criminal drives , the hobbies he or she might have , etc . Please explain like I'm five.",They do n't . Criminal profiling is a pretty controversial topic among professionals . For every criminal profile that is right there is usually one that is wrong . The efficacy of criminal profiling is hotly debated . It does n't help that shows misrepresent what it is and how well is works .,"Forensic psychologists use a variety of techniques to create criminal profiles, but they do not typically include very specific details like the make, model, and color of a suspect's car or their hobbies. Instead, they focus on analyzing the characteristics of the crime and the behavior of the perpetrator to create a profile of the person who is most likely to have committed the crime. 
To create a criminal profile, forensic psychologists may consider factors such as the type of crime that was committed, the age and gender of the victim, and any other details about the crime scene that may be relevant. They may also review police reports and interviews with witnesses to gather additional information about the crime. 
Once they have gathered this information, forensic psychologists use their training in psychology and criminal behavior to make educated guesses about the characteristics of the person who committed the crime. For example, they may consider whether the crime was committed in a very organized or a very disorganized manner, which can provide clues about the personality and level of intelligence of the perpetrator. 
Overall, the goal of creating a criminal profile is to help law enforcement narrow down their list of suspects and ultimately identify and catch the person who committed the crime."

Here 's another quarter , and another loss : URL_0 how are they still in business ? Please explain like I'm five.","I have a long running hypothesis . AMD is secretly owned by Intel to prevent antitrust legal action for being a monopoly . They never make money , are always one step behind and never go out of business .","It's important to note that a company can still be successful and have a positive impact on the economy, even if it experiences losses in some quarters or years. There are a few reasons why a company like AMD might continue to operate despite reporting losses: 
1. The company may have a strong financial foundation: AMD may have a large cash reserve or access to credit that allows it to continue operating despite experiencing losses. 
2. The company may be investing in growth: Sometimes a company will report losses because it is investing in new products, technologies, or markets that it expects will generate profits in the future. This can be seen as a long-term investment in the company's growth and success. 
3. The company may be facing short-term challenges: A company might experience losses due to temporary issues, such as increased competition, changes in market conditions, or supply chain disruptions. These challenges can be addressed over time, and the company may return to profitability once they are resolved. 
It's also worth noting that not all types of losses are created equal. For example, some losses may be due to one-time expenses, such as legal settlements or restructuring costs, while others may be ongoing operational expenses. This can affect how a company's losses are perceived and whether they are seen as a long-term concern or a temporary issue."

26,Pro - Union vs. Anti - Union arguments . Why is there so much controversy in America surrounding support or opposition of unions ? Please explain like I'm five.,"It 's largely politics . Unions tend to be very strong supporters of the Democratic party , and that does n't sit well with Republicans . But , for some specific points of contention : * Unions fight for what they think is a fair wage . Some people think that wage is unreasonably high . * Unions support closed shop laws , which make it illegal to hold certain jobs if you 're not in a union . Others support right to work laws , because they do n't think union membership should be mandatory . * In theory , unions work for better conditions for workers . However , some unions are corrupt , linked to organized crime , and hold nonunion workers in contempt .","Unions are organizations that workers can join to advocate for better working conditions, wages, and benefits. Some people believe that unions are important because they help workers have a stronger voice in the workplace and can help improve the lives of workers. Other people believe that unions can be harmful because they can make it harder for companies to do business and can lead to higher prices for goods and services. 
The controversy surrounding unions in America often stems from differing beliefs about the role of government and business in society. Some people believe that the government should do more to protect the rights of workers and that unions are an important way to do this. Others believe that the government should stay out of business decisions and that unions can get in the way of a company's ability to be competitive and successful. 
There are also often differing beliefs about the role of unions in the economy. Some people believe that unions help to create a more balanced distribution of wealth and power, while others believe that unions can hurt the economy by making it harder for companies to operate and compete. 
Overall, the controversy surrounding unions in America is complex and multifaceted, and there are valid arguments on both sides."

Just saw the Comet pictures and it made me wonder . Please explain like I'm five.","We could now . But this probe was launched 10 years ago , and was designed and built mostly during the 90s .","There are a few reasons why we might not have high resolution color cameras on some space probes and satellites. One reason is that these devices often need to be small and lightweight in order to be launched into space. Adding a high resolution color camera would add extra weight and complexity to the design, which could make it more difficult and expensive to launch. 
Another reason is that the cameras need to be able to withstand the harsh conditions of space, including extreme temperatures, radiation, and micrometeoroid impacts. These conditions can be tough on electronic devices, so the cameras need to be robust and reliable in order to function properly. 
Finally, it can also be expensive to design and build high resolution color cameras that are specifically designed for use in space. There are also many other scientific instruments and sensors that are needed on these probes and satellites, so there may not be enough room or resources to include a high resolution color camera. 
I hope this helps to explain why we might not have high resolution color cameras on some space probes and satellites."

Please explain like I'm five.,"ANY cell can get cancer . Your professor is likely citing a statistic that suggests that breastfeeding lowers chances of cancer significantly , but I think it 's naive to say milk production completely stops cancer development .

I 'm not sure of the correlation between breastfeeding ( or milk production ) and cancer growth , but * all * cells can mutate in this way . It 's just that ; like smoking increases the risk of this mutation , so can breastfeeding reduce that risk . Frighteningly , * anyone * can develop cancer .

The breast is made up of various types of cells, including glandular cells, which produce milk, and connective tissue cells. Cancer can develop in either of these types of cells, as well as in other cells in the breast. The most common type of breast cancer is ductal carcinoma, which starts in the cells lining the milk ducts. 
It is important for all individuals to be aware of the signs and symptoms of breast cancer and to practice regular self-exams and seek medical care if they notice any changes in their breasts. It is also important to get regular mammograms and other screenings, as recommended by a healthcare provider, in order to detect breast cancer early and increase the chances of successful treatment."
29,"How vulnerable are TOR users . I 'm not literally 5 , and I have a basic knowledge of computers , but I simply ca n't understand [ this ] ( URL_0 ) . How can an attacker deanonymize a victim using this procedure ? Please explain like I'm five.","The news article you posted does n't do a great deal of explaining , but the [ published paper ] ( URL_0 ;) is quite useful . Particularly , the attack summarised through the following steps : 1 ) Client downloads a file from the server that colludes with the adversary . 2 ) While the download progresses , the server injects a repeating traffic pattern in the TCP connection it sees originating from the exit node . 3 ) After sometime the download process is stopped and the server halts the traffic shaping procedure . 4 ) The adversary obtains network statistics from flow records corresponding to the server to exit traffic and for the various clients that used the victim entry node for the duration of the attack experiment . 5 ) If the flows are not correctly aligned , equally long and evenly separated , then the adversary applies the approximation strategy to correctly align them . 6 ) The adversary thereafter computes correlation coefficient for the server to exit traffic network statistics and for all the individual clients that used the victim entry node during the attack experiment . 7 ) The victim client ’s statistics is expected to be most correlated to the server to exit node traffic . Thus the client , whose traffic statistics are most correlated to the exit node traffic are chosen as the victim and verified . Basically , if the NSA controlled a service you were trying to access via Tor , they could send specially shaped packets to act as a sort of label . Even though the data is encrypted and anonymised through Tor ( between the entry and exit nodes ) , if the NSA controlled a lot of routers or major Internet exchange points , they could still track the special packets from the server to the first exit - node , through the middlemen , and finally ( and imperatively ) back through the original entry node & back to your original connection . But that 's not nearly ELI5 enough so I 'll do a * really simplified * analogy which gets the idea across : * * TL;DR * * - say Tor was n't actually an Internet thing and instead was a way of anonymously sending physical mail . If the sender of the parcel was malicious ( eg , an NSA controlled honeypot site ) they could send out really heavy parcels instead of normal , small , letters . So even if the parcel gets repackaged in different boxes or wrapping paper with new labels on ( the middlemen trying to anonymise the post ) , at the end of the day , the client is still going to be receiving a really heavy ass parcel . Even though it may look different , the weight of the packet indicates it 's the same packet which the NSA sent out . Which , in and of itself is pretty useless . But if the NSA controlled most of the postmen , they can just ask them if anyone got a really heavy parcel delivered that day . If they 're lucky , one of the postmen they control remembers delivering a super heavy parcel to 23 Jump Road , Michigan , USA . And then you 're fucked . But critically this relies on two things : having control of the end server , and being able to monitor major Internet exchange points in near real - time , and we 're talking hundreds if not thousands of gigabytes per second here . Theoretically yes Tor is vulnerable but this paper does n't prove it can actually be exploited in any meaningful manner to intercept communications between two end users that want to remain anonymous .","TOR, or The Onion Router, is a network that allows users to browse the internet anonymously by routing their traffic through multiple layers of servers, or ""nodes,"" before it reaches its destination. This makes it difficult for anyone to trace the traffic back to the original user. 
However, TOR is not completely foolproof, and there are ways that an attacker could potentially deanonymize a victim using the TOR network. One way this could happen is if the attacker is able to compromise a node in the TOR network and monitor the traffic passing through it. If the victim is using a vulnerable device or operating system, the attacker may be able to exploit a security flaw to reveal the victim's IP address or other identifying information. 
Another way an attacker could potentially deanonymize a victim using TOR is by setting up a ""fake"" node on the TOR network and enticing the victim to connect to it. The attacker could then monitor the victim's traffic and potentially reveal their identity. 
It's important to remember that while TOR can help protect your anonymity online, it is not a guarantee of complete anonymity. It's always a good idea to use caution and take steps to secure your device and protect your personal information when using the internet, whether you're using TOR or not."

Should n't Foxtel be you pay and you do nt get ads , or it should be free and you get ads . Please explain like I'm five.","It used to be ad free , it was launched on that as a premise . The simplest answer I can give is profit .","Foxtel and YouTube are two different types of services, and they operate in different ways. Foxtel is a subscription-based service, which means you pay a monthly fee to access the content they offer. This content is usually exclusive and not available for free on other platforms. In exchange for this exclusivity and the cost of producing and acquiring this content, Foxtel charges a subscription fee. 
On the other hand, YouTube is a free platform that is supported by advertising. When you watch a YouTube video, you may see ads before, during, or after the video. These ads help YouTube generate revenue, which is used to cover the costs of hosting and streaming the videos on their platform. 
In short, Foxtel charges a fee for access to exclusive content, while YouTube is free but displays ads to generate revenue. Both models have their pros and cons, and it's up to you to decide which one you prefer."
31,How did pirates / navy track down other ships back before radar / sonar ? I wondered this while watching Pirates of the Caribbean and wondered how ships chased each other down ? It 's not possible to track steps through ocean . Please explain like I'm five.,"they really did nt . But often you knew where ships were likely to be . There are only so many ports , and the bigger a ship the bigger a port it needs to be able to dock . A pirate might wait in the shipping lanes a day or two outside of a busy port and wait for a target . Or he might wait for a ship to dock and become a sitting target in an undefended port . A third choice is to cruise near nautical choke points like between islands or outside sandbars . Large convoys of vessels also usually took predictable routes , there was a range of a few degrees which offered the fastest trip to and from Europe due to trade winds and currents , and ships tried to avoid sailing in storm and hurricane season so there tended to be a good deal of activity when it was optimal for sailing . Once a ship was in sight it was then just a matter of who was the better seaman , or which ship was to windward , and in many cases some luck . Ships might be in sight but 20 miles away and still be in a chase .","Before radar and sonar were invented, pirates and navies used a variety of methods to track down other ships. One common method was to use visual clues, such as looking for the sails or smoke from the ship's chimney. They might also use telescopes or other instruments to help them spot ships at a distance. 
Another method was to use the stars and other celestial bodies as navigation aids. By looking at the position of the stars and other celestial objects, sailors could determine their own location and the direction they were heading. They could then use this information to figure out where other ships might be located. 
Sailors also used maps and charts to help them navigate the oceans. These could show them the locations of land masses, reefs, and other hazards, as well as the directions of the currents and winds. By using these tools, sailors could plan their routes and figure out the best way to reach their destination. 
Finally, sailors might use their own senses, such as hearing and smell, to help them locate other ships. For example, they might be able to hear the sound of another ship's anchor being dropped or the smell of wood smoke from its chimney. 
Overall, while tracking down other ships was difficult before the invention of modern technology, sailors were still able to use a variety of tools and techniques to navigate the oceans and locate other ships."
32,"Why does mixing lights result in a different color than mixing paint ? for example green + red = yellow in lights , and brown in paint . why does this happened . Please explain like I'm five.","Mixing light together is simple addition . Adding red light to green light gives you yellow light , add in blue and get white light . Paint , on the other hand , is about absorption and reflection . Yellow paint absorbs blue light , and reflects red and green . Red paint absorbs green and blue light , and reflects red . Mix them together and you get a paint that absorbs blue light , absorbs half of green light and reflects the other half , and reflects red : orange paint .","Mixing different colors of light actually does result in a different color, just like mixing paint does. The difference is in how our eyes and brains interpret the colors. 
When you mix two colors of paint together, the pigments in the paint absorb certain wavelengths of light and reflect others. For example, red paint reflects red light and absorbs other colors. When you mix red and green paint together, the resulting color is a brownish color because the pigments in the paint are absorbing all of the colors of light except for brown. 
On the other hand, when you mix two colors of light together, like red and green, the resulting color is a bright yellow because the light is actually adding together. This is because light is made up of different wavelengths of energy, and when you mix two colors of light together, you are adding the wavelengths of energy together. 
So, the reason why mixing paint results in a different color than mixing light is because paint absorbs certain wavelengths of light, while light adds different wavelengths of energy together."
33,Why is Monsanto considered to be such an evil company by so many people ? What have they done ? What are they currently doing ? Please explain like I'm five.,"My family farms and I believe it stems from being associated with GMO 's and as for the suing farmers thing I have no idea how it got so blown out of proportion . First , by buying Monsanto 's seeds you agree to not use the seeds grown for another crop and they are allowed onto your field to check . If you do n't like it you can buy , a usually poorer yielding , type of seed . Second , if there is cross contamination from a field you are NOT sued , Monsanto pays for the clean - up and crop lost . Finally , you can look up the actual number of lawsuits its 145 since 1997 with only 11 going to court . You have to be blatantly saving the seeds and seeding them to be sued .","Monsanto is a company that produces agricultural products, including seeds and chemicals. Some people believe that Monsanto is an evil company because they have been involved in several controversial practices. 
One reason some people view Monsanto as evil is because they have been accused of producing genetically modified organisms (GMOs) that may have negative impacts on the environment and human health. These GMOs are plants or animals that have had their DNA altered in a laboratory in order to give them certain desired traits, such as resistance to pests or the ability to grow in certain conditions. Some people are concerned that these genetically modified organisms could harm the natural environment and have unintended consequences for human health. 
Another reason some people view Monsanto as evil is because the company has been accused of using questionable tactics to promote their products and protect their patents. For example, Monsanto has been accused of suing farmers who saved and replanted seeds from their crops, even though this is a common practice among farmers. The company has also been accused of attempting to influence the scientific research and regulatory processes related to their products. 
Monsanto is no longer a standalone company. In 2018, it was acquired by the pharmaceutical company Bayer."
34,why are stormclouds gray when normal clouds are white ? Should nt it just be water particles in both cases ? Please explain like I'm five.,"Yes , but the reason why it is darker is due to there being larger sized particles in the clouds . As they are getting closer to what we know as rain . This absorbs light differently light differently , thus making the cloud appear darker .","Storm clouds are gray because they contain a lot of water droplets that are very close together. When light from the sun or other sources passes through these droplets, it scatters in all directions. This is what makes the clouds appear white. 
However, storm clouds are often much denser and contain a lot more water droplets than normal clouds. This means that more light is scattered in all directions, which can make the clouds appear darker. This is why storm clouds are often gray. 
Normal clouds are white because they also contain water droplets, but these droplets are farther apart from each other. This means that less light is scattered in all directions, which makes the clouds appear white. 
Overall, the color of clouds is determined by the amount of water droplets they contain and how these droplets scatter light. Storm clouds appear gray because they contain a lot of water droplets that scatter a lot of light in all directions, while normal clouds appear white because they contain fewer water droplets that scatter less light."

Mathis has apparently spent nearly $ 40,000 developing the symbol and advocating its inclusion as the 27th letter of the alphabet . * Meaning that that $ 40,000 has n't just gone into the development of the symbol , which most likely cost only a fraction of the money , but also into trying to convince people to use it , probably travelling around to attend linguistic conferences etc etc .","It is not clear from your question where the $40,000 figure comes from or what the context is for this expenditure. However, it is possible that someone could spend a large amount of money trying to develop a new alphabet letter or symbol to represent the word ""the"" as part of a larger project to create a new writing system or modify an existing one. This could involve research, design work, prototyping, testing, and marketing, among other things. It could also involve paying for the services of experts or consultants in fields such as linguistics, typography, or communication design. However, it is important to note that creating a new alphabet letter or symbol is a complex and challenging task that would likely require a significant investment of time, resources, and expertise."
36,The differences between flash and HTML5 Which one is better for me as a user ? Please explain like I'm five.,"They are really quite different . HTML is the language that websites are written in . It describes what elements are in the page and how they 're organized ( elements such as text , images , buttons and links ) . However , HTML originally did n't include the ability to show graphics , animations or videos ( other than pre - rendered images and animated gifs ) . HTML did provide the ability to include embedded objects , which would require the user to install a plugin that could display them . One such common plugin was Flash , which was basically another small program that runs inside your browser ( another such plugin is Java which can display Java Applets , but they 're hardly in use anymore ) . So developers could use Flash to create things like games ( such as the ones you 'll find in URL_0 ) and video players ( such as YouTube ) . HTML5 introduces new features to HTML , mainly the support for the < canvas > and < video > elements . These tags could be used to display graphics and videos without the need for an external plugin , and were handled by the browser and not by the plugin . HTML5 introduces many other new features , but these are the ones that are most relevant to this discussion ( HTML5 vs Flash ) . The main advantage of HTML5 is that it 's a standard that 's supported ( or should be supported ) by every browser . On the contrary , Flash is no longer supported by Apple 's devices , and by Android 's stock browser . Another disadvantage of Flash is that it 's considered slow and inefficient .","Flash and HTML5 are both technologies that are used to create and display content on the internet. Flash is a software platform that was developed by Adobe and is used to create animations, games, and other interactive content. HTML5 is a version of the HTML programming language that is used to create the structure and layout of websites and web applications. 
As a user, it's important to know that Flash and HTML5 are not directly competing technologies. They are simply two different ways of creating and displaying content on the internet, and each has its own strengths and weaknesses. 
Here are some key differences between Flash and HTML5: 
Compatibility: Flash requires a separate plug-in to be installed in your web browser in order to work, while HTML5 is built into most modern browsers and does not require any additional software. This means that HTML5 content is generally more widely compatible and can be accessed on a wider range of devices, including smartphones and tablets.
Performance: HTML5 content tends to perform better than Flash content, especially on mobile devices. This is because HTML5 content is designed to be lightweight and efficient, while Flash content can be more resource-intensive and may not run as smoothly on some devices.
Security: Flash has a reputation for being less secure than HTML5, as it is more susceptible to malware and other types of online threats. HTML5, on the other hand, has built-in security features that help to protect against these types of threats. 
Ultimately, which technology is ""better"" for you as a user will depend on your specific needs and preferences. If you need to access interactive content or games on the internet, then Flash may be a good option for you. If you are primarily interested in accessing static content (such as text and images) or using web-based applications, then HTML5 may be a better choice."
37,"Why does my pizza box say preheat oven , when I can just put it in for a couple minutes longer and it 's the same thing ? It also says ( keep pizza frozen while preheating ) , what difference does that make ? Please explain like I'm five.","Pizza companies want you to keep coming back to their pizzas , so they add foolproof instructions . People have different ovens , so "" cooking "" while preheating is going to have random results , and they just ca n't tell people to do that if they have terrible ovens .","Preheating the oven is important because it ensures that the oven has reached the proper temperature before you start cooking your pizza. If you put the pizza in an oven that is not hot enough, it will take longer to cook and the crust may not turn out as crispy as you'd like. 
As for the instructions to keep the pizza frozen while preheating the oven, this is probably because the pizza will cook more evenly if it goes into the oven frozen. When the pizza is frozen, the heat of the oven will thaw and cook it gradually, rather than going straight from cold to hot and potentially cooking unevenly. 
Overall, following the instructions on the pizza box (such as preheating the oven and keeping the pizza frozen) can help you achieve the best possible results when cooking your pizza."
38,"How does Amazon get their items shipped to your house so quickly , no matter what it is ? Do they have big factories in every state carrying every possible item they sell ? Please explain like I'm five.","Amazon fills up their distribution centers with popular items that are quickly sold . When you order something through Amazon from some store that you 've never heard of on the far side of the country , Amazon picks up an identical copy ( if they have one in stock ) from the closest distribution center to where you live and ship it out nearly immediately . The one from the store replaces the one in the distribution center . This is why sometimes a description will make a used item sound in poor shape , but when you get it , it 's better than you expected . This is how you can get popular or common items easily , but if you order something really weird or off the wall , it has to actually come from that store , through Amazon and then to your house and takes a lot longer . I used to work in a distribution center .","Amazon has a very efficient system for getting items shipped to customers quickly. Here's how it works: 
1. When you order something from Amazon, the company uses its computer systems to find the item you want in one of its many warehouses around the world. These warehouses are like giant stores where Amazon keeps all of the items it sells. 
2. Once the computer finds the item, it tells a worker to pick it up and put it in a box. 
3. The box is then sent to a sorting facility, where it is sorted and sent to a package delivery company like FedEx or UPS. 
4. The delivery company then takes the box and brings it to your house. 
So, Amazon doesn't necessarily have big factories in every state, but it does have a network of warehouses around the world where it keeps a wide variety of items. When you order something from Amazon, the company is able to quickly find the item and get it shipped to you through this system."
39,how is filibustering even a thing ? Why is filibustering even considered a valid tactic in politics ? Why is it simply not dismissed and does it have any practical uses ? Please explain like I'm five.,"Filibustering is a tactic that evolved in the Senate . It 's often called a "" parliamentary procedure , "" as it results not from constitutional law but the internal rules of the legislature . In order to allow time for a bill to be discussed and debated , a 60 vote majority is required to proceed from discussion to a vote . Senators realized they could exploit this rule to keep the majority from passing a bill , unless they had a 60 - vote majority ( a "" Fillibuster - proof majority . "" Filibusters used to require a significant investment of time . Senators grew weary of the pain of a filibuster , and today , the mere threat of a filibuster is enough to get a bill withdrawn due to the time involved ( [ Senators in the past were known to read recipes , Shakespeare , anything in sight ] ( URL_0 ) ) Now , to your questions : Why is it valid ? Because it works for the minority party . Why is it not simply dismissed ? No majority will eliminate it because they know it will be useful to them in the future . You 'll hear of the "" Nuclear Option "" from time to time , a threat to eliminate the filibuster by changing the rules ( by simple majority ) . So far , it has not happened . I would n't be surprised to see it happen in the next congress - the rise of use of filibuster is unprecedented ( the filibuster itself is less than 100 years old ) and scorched - earth politicking has become more and more common inside the beltway . Does it have any practical uses ? Yes : It 's a tool for the minority party to block particularly controversial legislation .","Filibustering is a tactic used by politicians in some countries, including the United States, to try to block or delay a vote on a bill or proposal. It's called filibustering because it can involve a politician giving a very long speech or talking for a long time in order to delay the vote. 
Filibustering is considered a valid tactic in politics because it allows politicians to have a say in the decision-making process and to express their views and concerns. It can also be used as a way to force a compromise or a change in the proposal being considered. 
However, filibuster can also be used as a way to block or delay important decisions or progress on important issues. Some people argue that filibuster should be reformed or limited in order to allow the government to function more efficiently and to make sure that important issues are not held up for too long. 
Overall, filibuster can be a useful tactic for ensuring that all voices are heard and for allowing for discussion and debate, but it can also be abused and used to obstruct the work of the government."

They are either realistic looking mannikins or four - month old babies slathered in blood makeup .,"Movies and TV shows often use newborn babies as actors for scenes that require a baby to be shown on screen. These babies are usually provided by baby casting agencies, which are companies that specialize in finding and hiring babies and young children for roles in the entertainment industry. 
The babies used in movies and TV shows are typically a few weeks or months old, and they are usually accompanied by a parent or guardian on set. The babies are carefully supervised by the production team and are only used for short periods of time to ensure their safety and well-being. 
In some cases, filmmakers may use props or special effects to create the appearance of a newborn baby on screen, rather than using a real baby. This can be done using dolls, animatronics, or computer-generated imagery (CGI). However, it is often more realistic to use real babies when they are needed in a scene."

One was , it 's close to the equator . [ The linear velocity of Earth 's surface is greatest at the equator , much as a ceiling fan blade slices through the air faster at its tip than at its center hub , conferring a fuel - saving boost to spacecraft attempting to escape Earth 's gravity.—Editor 's Note ] The second reason was it had to be on the east coast , over the ocean , so you would n't fly over people that might get killed as stuff dropped off or blew up . And the location that they chose in Florida had a lot to do with the fact that there was n't anything there . You go there today and you do n't see it , but Brevard County in the 1940s was a bunch of orchards and hardly anything else . And this island that they 're on [ Merritt Island ] had good logistics , because there was a navy base and an army base not too far away . But there was no population density whatsoever . It was just a beach , essentially . So you could build what you wanted , but it had decent roads because of the military , and that was important . This is one of the problems that [ the Soviet Union ] had with Baikonur [ Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan ] , their launch site . I mean , it is in the middle of nowhere . They had to build a whole infrastructure to run rail out there , to build highways , to bring in all of the water and power and everything else that was necessary to make that place habitable . [ source ] ( URL_0 )","NASA, which stands for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, is based in Florida for a few reasons. One reason is because Florida is close to the equator, which makes it easier to launch rockets into space. This is because the Earth's rotation is faster at the equator, which means that rockets can get a little extra ""boost"" when they launch. 
Another reason is because Florida has a long history with space travel. The first American astronaut, Alan Shepard, launched into space from Florida in 1961. Since then, many other important space missions have launched from Florida, including the Apollo missions to the Moon and the space shuttle program. 
Finally, Florida has a lot of open space and good weather, which makes it a good place to test and launch rockets. The Kennedy Space Center, which is located on the east coast of Florida, is the main launch site for NASA and has been used for many important space missions. 
So, in short, Florida is a good place for NASA to launch rockets because it's close to the equator, has a long history with space travel, and has a lot of open space and good weather."

The Japanese media industry is known for producing a wide variety of content, including video games, TV shows, and music, that often incorporates elements of Japanese culture and history. This can include things like traditional Japanese instruments and themes, as well as more modern and unconventional elements. 
It's also worth noting that different parts of Japanese culture can have different levels of conservatism. For example, some aspects of Japanese culture, such as traditional family structure or gender roles, may be more conservative, while other parts of Japanese culture, such as the media industry, may be more open to experimentation and innovation.

These cities have high costs for things like housing, food, and transportation, which can make it hard for people who don't have a lot of money to afford the things they need. 
One way that people with minimum wage jobs can try to make ends meet is by finding ways to save money. For example, they might look for cheaper places to live, such as shared apartments or homes, or they might try to find ways to save money on food, such as by cooking at home instead of eating out. 
Another way that people with minimum wage jobs can try to get by is by finding ways to make more money. This might involve getting a second job, finding ways to earn extra money on the side, or even starting their own business. 
It's also important for people with minimum wage jobs to be smart about their money and to make a budget to help them stay on track. This might involve setting aside money for important expenses, like rent and bills, and cutting back on unnecessary expenses, like going out to eat or buying expensive clothes. 
Overall, it can be challenging for people with minimum wage jobs to get by in cities with high costs of living, but with careful planning and hard work, it is possible to make ends meet."

Please explain to to me what happens to all this excess military equipment . Please explain like I'm five.,"Hey , US Army Infantryman who is actually in Afghanistan right now here . In an Infantry platoon it is the Platoon Sergeant 's job to maintain accountability of all men , weapons , and equipment . He does this by maintaining a MAL ( master authorization list ) given to him by the Company 's Armorer when weapons are signed out from the arms room . When a Soldier is injured or killed during combat operations he / she is put onto a MEDEVAC ( medical evacuation ) vehicle , whether it be a helicopter or some form of ground transportation . Prior to the Soldier being loaded all of his equipment is stripped off of him / her and retained by the unit . If the Soldier carried a crucial casualty producing weapon , like a machine gun with a higher rate of fire than the standard M4 , it will be given to the next most qualified person along with all the ammo . This is to try and maintain the combat effectiveness , AKA how many bullets you can throw at people , despite having less people . As for the gear , after it is recovered back to a FOB ( Forward Operating Base ) all gear that was worn by a casualty is inspected by people certified to determine whether it is serviceable . If an item is not serviceable and the casualty is still alive the inspectors will make an effort to send the item to the casualty 's home . It is not uncommon for Soldiers who received gunshots to their helmets to get to keep those for life . Enemy equipment is another story .

TL;DR Platoon Sergeant is responsible for recovering friendly equipment to the best of his abilities and repaired as quickly as possible . Enemy equipment is analyzed by Military intelligence or destroyed on the spot .","When soldiers are killed in conflict, their weapons and gear are often collected and returned to their home country or military base. The weapons are typically taken out of service and either destroyed or stored for later use. The gear, such as clothing and other equipment, is also collected and either cleaned or repaired for reuse or discarded if it is not in good condition. 
It is important to keep track of and properly dispose of military equipment because it can be dangerous if it falls into the wrong hands. In some cases, the equipment may be donated to other countries or organizations that need it.

Why is the price of oil going down ? Hard to say , but Saudi Arabia is pumping a lot more than usual and has n't slowed down to keep prices up . Also , the US and Canada have started producing a lot more oil thanks to a new technology called fracking . Ignore the guy that said its election politics -- even the US is n't big enough to move global oil prices down that much for that long .","There are a few reasons why gas prices have gone down in the past few months. 
One reason is that there is currently a lot of oil being produced around the world. Oil is used to make gasoline, so when there is a lot of oil available, it can help to lower the price of gasoline. 
Another reason is that people are using less gasoline due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Many people are staying at home and not driving as much, which means there is less demand for gasoline. When there is less demand for a product, the price of that product tends to go down. 
Finally, some countries produce and export a lot of oil, and the price of oil is often influenced by the relationships between these countries and how they trade with each other. If there is a lot of oil being produced and exported by certain countries, it can help to lower the price of gasoline. 
So, in summary, gas prices have gone down because there is currently a lot of oil being produced, people are using less gasoline due to the pandemic, and the relationships between oil-producing countries can also affect the price."

It states that no person shall ""be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb."" This means that if someone is acquitted (found not guilty) of a crime, they cannot be tried again for the same crime. 
The Double Jeopardy Clause is designed to protect people from being subjected to the stress and expense of multiple trials for the same crime. It also helps to prevent the government from using its power to try to punish someone over and over again until it gets the result it wants. 
However, there are some exceptions to the Double Jeopardy Clause. For example, if new evidence is discovered that was not available at the time of the original trial, it may be possible to bring someone to trial again for the same crime. Additionally, the Double Jeopardy Clause does not apply in cases where the crime was committed in different states or in cases where the person was tried in both a state court and a federal court."

52,"How do vegetables get vitamins and minerals if they only "" eat "" water and sunlight ? Where does it all come from ? Please explain like I'm five.",They also take in nutrients from the dirt . That 's how you can get things like iron etc .,"Vegetables get their vitamins and minerals from the soil and the water that they absorb through their roots. The soil contains a variety of nutrients that plants need to grow and thrive, including vitamins and minerals. When a plant absorbs water from the soil, it also takes in these nutrients along with it. The plant then uses these nutrients to produce energy through photosynthesis, which is the process of converting sunlight into energy. 
So, in a way, vegetables ""eat"" the nutrients that are in the soil and water, and use the energy from sunlight to turn those nutrients into the vitamins and minerals that they need to survive. This is how vegetables are able to provide us with important nutrients when we eat them. Does this help to clarify things?"
53,"Why in the NATO phonetic alphabet do you pronounce "" 9 "" as "" niner "" instead of just saying "" nine "" ? URL_0 Please explain like I'm five.","There 's a clue in the NATO bit . Germany are a NATO member - in German , ' Nein ' is ' no ' - so if you can make the digit sound different from a common word used by one of your co - members is probably going to be useful .","In the NATO phonetic alphabet, each letter of the alphabet is represented by a specific word. The word ""niner"" is used to represent the number ""9"" because it is easier to understand and less prone to confusion than just saying the word ""nine.""

Some people believe that Banksy is the pseudonym of a single person, while others believe that it may be a group of artists who work together. 
There are a few ways that experts can tell if a piece of graffiti is by Banksy or not. One way is by looking at the style of the artwork. Banksy's art has a distinctive style that is instantly recognizable to many people, and experts can often tell if a piece of graffiti is by Banksy just by looking at it. 
Another way to tell if a piece of graffiti is by Banksy is by looking at the location where it was created. Banksy often creates his graffiti in secret and in unexpected places, so if a piece of graffiti is found in a place where Banksy is known to have worked, it is more likely to be by him. 
Finally, experts can also use other clues to determine if a piece of graffiti is by Banksy, such as the materials and techniques that were used to create it. For example, Banksy often uses stencils to create his graffiti, so if a piece of graffiti was made using stencils, it is more likely to be by him. 
Overall, while it is not always possible to know for certain if a piece of graffiti is by Banksy or not, experts can use a combination of these methods to make an educated guess."
56,"Why is n't there thunder and lightning during a snowstorm ? Because are n't rain and snow basically the same thing , except one is colder ? Please explain like I'm five.",I have watched a snowstorm with lightning and thunder .,"Thunder and lightning are caused by the movement of electrical charges within a cloud or between a cloud and the ground. Snow is made up of frozen water vapor, while rain is made up of liquid water. During a snowstorm, the air is typically too cold for the snow to melt and become rain, so there is no movement of electrical charges and therefore no thunder or lightning. 
To understand this better, think about the difference between ice and water. Ice is a solid, while water is a liquid. If you put ice in a warm room, it will eventually melt and become water. Similarly, if the air is warm enough, snow will melt and become rain. But if the air is cold, the snow will stay frozen and there won't be any thunder or lightning."

HTML5 and GIFs serve different purposes and are used for different types of content on the web. 
HTML5 is more efficient than GIFs in terms of data usage because it allows you to display images and other types of media directly in the HTML code, without having to use separate image files. This means that you can include images and other media on your web pages without adding extra data to your website. In contrast, GIFs are separate image files that have to be downloaded separately from the HTML code, which can increase the amount of data needed to load a web page.

58,why does the electric company provides incentives to purchase CFL over incandescent light bulbs ? Does nt the electric company makes money of off kW / hr ? So more usage = more revenue ? Please explain like I'm five.,"For many utility companies , it is cheaper to give customers CFLs instead of adding production capacity ( building power plants ) . Some states also mandate that utility companies spend a certain amount of money reducing consumption before building new plants .","Electric companies make money by selling electricity to customers. The amount of electricity that a customer uses is measured in kilowatt-hours (kWh). The electric company charges a certain amount of money for each kWh of electricity that a customer uses. 
Using energy-efficient light bulbs, such as compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs), can help a customer use less electricity because these bulbs use less energy than traditional incandescent bulbs. If a customer uses less electricity, then they will pay less money to the electric company. 
However, the electric company still wants customers to use electricity because it is a source of revenue for them. So, the electric company may provide incentives, such as discounts or rebates, to encourage customers to switch to energy-efficient bulbs. This can help the electric company save money on their own energy costs, as well as help the environment by reducing energy consumption. 
In the end, both the electric company and the customer can benefit from using energy-efficient bulbs because it can lead to lower electricity bills and a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions."

Please explain like I'm five.,"Parchment is a service that schools use for transcripts so they do n't have to mess with it themselves . Parchment charges enough to make it profitable for them , but if it 's too expensive , it would alienate the high schools they depend on .

One reason is that the organizations that handle these services have different operating costs, such as employee salaries, technology expenses, and overhead costs like rent and utilities. Additionally, the demand for these services may also be different, which can impact the price. For example, more students may need to send transcripts to colleges and universities than ACT scores, so the cost of sending transcripts may be lower in order to make it more accessible for students. Finally, the cost of sending transcripts may also be lower because transcripts typically contain more information than a single ACT score, and it may be more expensive for the organization to process and transmit this additional information."
61,"Why do we refer inanimate objects as "" She "" more than ( if not always ) "" He "" ? Just wondering ... The question came up to me after browsing Kantai Collection 's wiki , and some wiki entries on battleships . Please explain like I'm five.","Because men own boats or hobby cars more often , and they do n't want to sound gay . "" Later today I 'm going to wax and shine my Brucey ""","In English, we often use gender-specific pronouns to refer to inanimate objects. This means that we might use ""she"" or ""her"" to refer to a ship or a car, even though these things are not alive and do not have a gender. This is a way of speaking that we have inherited from the way that English has evolved over time, and it is not based on any inherent qualities of the objects themselves. 
One reason why we might use ""she"" to refer to a ship is because ships have traditionally been given feminine names, especially in naval contexts. For example, a ship might be named after a woman or a mythological figure, such as the USS Constitution (also known as ""Old Ironsides"") which was named after the United States Constitution. Because ships are often given feminine names, it has become common to refer to them using feminine pronouns. 
It's also worth noting that different languages have different ways of referring to inanimate objects. In some languages, all nouns are either masculine or feminine, and the gender of the noun determines the gender of the pronoun used to refer to it. In English, this is not the case, and we can use any pronoun to refer to an inanimate object."

1. The Earth spins on its axis, which is an imaginary line that goes through the North Pole and South Pole. This is what makes it feel like the sun is rising and setting every day. If the Earth stopped spinning, the sun would just stay in one place in the sky and it would be very hot on one side of the Earth and very cold on the other side. 
2. The Earth's spin also helps to keep the oceans moving. If the Earth stopped spinning, the oceans would all pile up on one side of the Earth, and there would be a huge wave on the other side. 
3. The Earth's spin also helps to keep the atmosphere moving. If the Earth stopped spinning, the air would all pile up on one side of the Earth and there would be very strong winds on the other side. 
4. Finally, if the Earth stopped spinning, everything on the Earth would be thrown off into space. This includes all the people, animals, and buildings on the Earth. It would be a very big mess!

If they are successful in moving the ball 10 yards, they earn another set of downs. If the offense fails to move the ball 10 yards, possession of the ball is turned over to the other team (called the defense). 
One way for the offense to move the ball is by throwing it through the air (called a pass). The offense can also try to move the ball by running with it (called a rush). 
In the situation you are describing, it was probably considered ""bad"" for the Seattle Seahawks to pass the ball because it may not have been the most effective way for them to move the ball and get closer to scoring. There could be a number of reasons why passing the ball may not have been the best choice, such as the defense anticipating the pass and intercepting the ball, or the quarterback (the player who throws the ball) not having enough time to throw the ball due to pressure from the defense. 
It's also possible that the team had been trying to pass the ball and were not having success, and so it may have been more effective for them to try to run the ball or use a different strategy to try to move the ball down the field. Ultimately, the team's decision on whether to pass or run the ball will depend on a variety of factors, including the specific strengths and weaknesses of the offense and defense, the situation on the field, and the overall game plan."
66,How do doctors find out a persons allergy ? Do they take blood samples and can tell from that ? I 'm assuming that they just do n't shove a peanut in your face to see if you have nut allergy . Please explain like I'm five.,They place a grid on your body . Usually your back . 16 or so common allergens are then applied to your back and they see what your body reacts to .,"Doctors can use several different methods to find out if a person has allergies. One common method is to do a skin prick test. During this test, a small amount of an allergen (such as a substance that a person might be allergic to) is placed on the skin, and then a needle is used to prick the skin through the allergen. If the person is allergic to the allergen, they will develop a raised bump or rash on their skin. 
Another way to test for allergies is to do a blood test. During this test, a blood sample is taken from the person and sent to a laboratory, where it is tested for the presence of antibodies to specific allergens. Antibodies are proteins produced by the body's immune system in response to an allergen. If the person has allergies, their blood will contain high levels of these antibodies. 
It's important to note that doctors do not usually test for allergies by exposing a person to the allergen directly. This is because allergies can cause serious reactions, such as difficulty breathing or a drop in blood pressure, and it would be dangerous to intentionally trigger these reactions. Instead, doctors use safer methods, such as skin prick tests and blood tests, to test for allergies."

Please explain like I'm five.,"Of all the things that mutations cause ( that is , mutations that happen * after * a person has been born ) , most of them probably just end up with the mutated DNA getting repaired or removed , or the cell that contains it being destroyed through programmed cell death . Cancer is the result of a mutation that removes the cell 's ability to repair or quarantine mutations . It is n't that so much of DNA is devoted to reproduction that any one mutation is likely to damage that section of the DNA . It 's that , of all the mutations that happen , the ones that can survive and reproduce are necessarily the ones that alter the normal reproduction / cell death processes ( and these are the mutations that cause cancer . )","Cancer is not the most common disease associated with DNA mutations. In fact, most DNA mutations do not cause any significant problems or diseases. However, some DNA mutations can cause problems with the way cells function, and can lead to the development of cancer. 
Cancer is a disease in which cells in the body grow and divide in an uncontrolled way. Normal cells in the body follow a specific pattern of growth and division, but cancer cells do not. They continue to grow and divide even when the body does not need them, and they do not die when they should. This can lead to the formation of tumors, which can be harmful if they grow in certain parts of the body or if they spread to other parts of the body. 
There are many different factors that can increase the risk of developing cancer, including genetics, environmental factors, and lifestyle factors. DNA mutations can play a role in the development of cancer, but they are not the only cause.

68,Why do n't multi winged planes work ? [ Planes like this ] ( URL_0 ) alternatively why do planes typically have two or four wings ? Please explain like I'm five.,"they do work . biplanes and triplanes were quite advantageous in WWI . but the more wings you put on , the more lift you get , but the more drag and more strengthing structure you need to add .","Planes with multiple wings, like the one in the image you provided, are called ""multiplane"" or ""sesquiplane"" designs. These designs were experimented with in the early days of aviation, but they were not widely used because they did not perform as well as planes with fewer wings. 
There are several reasons why planes with multiple wings are not typically used. One reason is that they are more complex and expensive to build than planes with fewer wings. They also tend to be heavier and less efficient, which means that they require more power to fly and use more fuel. 
Planes with two wings, or ""biplanes,"" were the most common design in the early days of aviation. They are still used today in some specialty applications, such as crop dusting or airshows. Most modern planes, however, have a single, long wing called a ""monoplane."" This design is more aerodynamic and efficient, and it allows the plane to fly faster and further than a biplane. 
Four-winged planes, or ""quadruplanes,"" have also been experimented with, but they have not been widely used because they do not offer significant advantages over other designs. 
Overall, the number of wings on an airplane is determined by a combination of factors, including the size and weight of the plane, the type of mission it will be used for, and the desired performance characteristics. Engineers and designers carefully consider these factors when designing a new plane to ensure that it is safe, efficient, and capable of meeting the needs of its intended use."
69,What is the evolutionary advantage of wisdom teeth if all they do is cause us pain and fuck up our mouths ? looking for a friend . Please explain like I'm five.,"A more accurate way to phrase the question , a way that would also more or less answer it , is to ask , "" What is the evolutionary disadvantage of wisdom teeth to someone who has not yet procreated ? "" The answer is : not much . It 's tempting to think that evolution means useless things should disappear over time , sort of like a genetic atrophy , but they do n't work that way . Something has to specifically select _ against _ the useless feature . If having wisdom teeth made people less attractive , or raised the likelihood of them dying before reproducing , then we could postulate that there would be evolutionary pressure against larger wisdom teeth and that , over time , more and more people with smaller wisdom teeth would be selected , leading to a gradual evolutionary decline in wisdom teeth . Since that 's not the case , they 're here to stay . An analogue to help cement the idea would be the appendix . If it 's so useless and so ( potentially ) lethal , why do we still have it ? Because by the time someone 's appendix becomes inflamed , they 've probably already had kids and passed the genes along . If the median age for appendicitis over the last couple thousand years was more in the range of five - years - old , there would be much greater selective pressure to eliminate it .","Wisdom teeth, also known as third molars, are the last teeth to emerge in the mouth, usually appearing in the late teenage years or early twenties. These teeth were once an important part of the human diet because they helped people chew tough and fibrous foods that were common in our ancestors' diets. 
However, as our diets have changed and become softer over time, wisdom teeth have become less necessary. In many people, there is not enough room in the mouth for the wisdom teeth to emerge properly, which can cause problems such as pain, infection, and crowding of the other teeth. 
It's not entirely clear why wisdom teeth still exist if they can cause so many problems. Some scientists believe that wisdom teeth may have once served a useful purpose but are now vestigial, meaning that they have lost their original function due to evolution. Others think that wisdom teeth may still have some use, but more research is needed to understand this. 
Overall, wisdom teeth are a leftover from our ancestors' times and are not as important as they once were. However, they can still cause problems if they don't have enough room to emerge properly, so it's important to keep an eye on them and visit a dentist if you experience any pain or other issues."

However, it is not a legitimate source of oil and it is not possible to buy oil from ISIS through legal channels. It is illegal to provide material support to terrorist organizations, including buying goods from them, and doing so can result in serious consequences. It is also worth noting that the global price of oil is determined by a variety of factors, including supply and demand, geopolitical considerations, and economic conditions, and is not directly related to the activities of ISIS."

Talking about the specific photo you 've linked , you 're looking towards the centre yolk ( to continue the egg analogy ) so there 's a bright bulge . You can also see lanes of dust because there are some huge clouds of dust that block our view in certain directions . The dust lane here gives you a feel for the central plane of the galaxy ; it 's not quite vertical but at about a 1 o'clock angle . If you were in deep space ( so no ground to block your view below ) you could see the plane of the galaxy go 360^o around the sky . That 's the plane of the frying pan if you like .","Taking a photo of the Milky Way requires a few things: 
1. A camera: You'll need a camera that can take long exposures, which means it can keep the shutter open for a longer time to let in more light. This is important because the Milky Way is usually too dim to see with the naked eye, so you need to take a long exposure to capture it. 
2. A tripod: You'll need a tripod to hold your camera steady while you take the photo. This is important because if your camera moves even a little bit while the shutter is open, the photo will come out blurry. 
3. A dark sky: To see the Milky Way, you need to be somewhere with very little light pollution. This means you need to be far away from cities, which have lots of lights that can wash out the stars. 
4. The right time of year: The Milky Way is only visible in the night sky at certain times of the year. It's best to see it in the summer months when it's high in the sky. 
Once you have all of these things, you can set up your camera on the tripod and take a long exposure photo of the Milky Way. The photo will come out looking like a bright band of light across the sky, with lots of stars visible all around it."
73,"Why are all these police officers standing in front of a grand jury rather than facing a normal trial ? Also , what is the difference between a grand jury and a normal jury ? Please explain like I'm five.","Going to a grand jury * is * part of a normal trial ( at least for some kinds of cases ; it varies by state ) . A grand jury is a group of people that the prosecutor has to convince he has a case . He does n't have to prove that the defendant is guilty , just that there 's enough evidence that it 's OK to bring charges against them . The idea here is that the trial itself should not be inflicted upon someone who is obviously innocent — bringing charges must not be a weapon against innocent charges . Charging innocent people can still happen , but this step is intended to minimize it . The controversy is that generally grand juries are very easy to convince and many see them as a formality more than anything . When a high profile case does n't get an indictment ( i.e. a formal accusation against someone that a crime was committed ; pronounced in - dight - ment ) it raises a question of whether the prosecutor was really trying to get the grand jury to indict . Many feel that even though the officer in the Ferguson case would likely have been found innocent that it was not the prosecutor 's place to present such a weak case to the grand jury in order to stop the case then and there .","A grand jury is a group of people who are chosen to decide whether there is enough evidence to charge someone with a crime. If the grand jury decides that there is enough evidence, they will issue a ""true bill"" of indictment, which means that the person will be charged with a crime and will have to go to trial. 
Grand juries are different from normal juries in a few ways. One difference is that grand juries don't decide whether someone is guilty or not guilty. Their job is only to decide if there is enough evidence to charge someone with a crime. Grand juries also don't have to follow the same rules as a normal trial. For example, the person being investigated by the grand jury doesn't have the right to be present or to have a lawyer present during the grand jury proceedings. 
It's not uncommon for police officers to appear before a grand jury when they are being investigated for a crime. This might happen if someone has accused the police officer of wrongdoing, or if there is evidence that the officer broke the law. If the grand jury decides that there is enough evidence to charge the police officer with a crime, then the officer will have to go to trial to face those charges."
74,What makes one tire better than another ? Why does the tire on a Bugatti cost $ 5000 but the tire on my Cruze costs $ 150 ? What 's the difference ? Please explain like I'm five.,"Suitability for purpose , where purpose has a number of dimensions . For the Bugatti , one of the dimensions has to be "" can survive the 250MPH top speed of the car , "" and cost is going to be much less of a factor , given the market space the car is aimed at ( the extremely wealthy ) . For a Cruze , budget pricing is going to be high on the list , and the top speed is maybe as high as 130MPH at a guess . Other dimensions include wet and dry grip , cold weather performance , rolling resistance ( very helpful for high EPA fuel economy estimates ) , road noise , resistance to wear , special features like runflat capability , etc . , etc . The formulation of the rubber compounds that go into the tire , the design of the tread , the layout of the steel ( and other materials ? ) belts that go into the casing , etc . , are all informed by which criteria are emphasized in the tire 's design .","There are a few factors that can make one tire better than another, and these factors can also contribute to differences in price. 
First, let's start with the basics: tires are made of rubber, and they have tread on the bottom that helps them grip the road. Tires also have a sidewall, which is the part of the tire that you can see between the tread and the wheel. The sidewall has important information printed on it, like the size of the tire and the maximum load and speed it can handle. 
Now, let's talk about some of the factors that can make one tire better than another: 
1. Performance: Some tires are designed for specific types of driving or weather conditions. For example, you might want a tire with a softer compound for better grip on a race track, or a tire with a lot of tread for better traction in the rain. Tires that are designed for high performance or specific driving conditions tend to cost more because they require more advanced materials and engineering. 
2. Quality: Tires can also vary in terms of quality, which can affect their performance and lifespan. Higher-quality tires are typically made with better materials and more advanced manufacturing processes, which can make them last longer and perform better. These tires tend to cost more, but they can save you money in the long run because you won't have to replace them as often. 
3. Brand: The brand of the tire can also affect the price. Some tire brands are known for making high-quality, high-performance tires that come with a higher price tag. Other brands might offer more budget-friendly options that may not have the same level of performance or quality. 
So, to sum it up: tires can vary in price based on their performance, quality, and brand. Tires that are designed for high performance or specific driving conditions, made with high-quality materials and advanced manufacturing processes, or made by a well-known brand tend to cost more."
75,How are movies edited to be in 3D when they are't originally filmed in 3D ? Like Lord of the Rings Please explain like I'm five.,"They have a bunch of people cut out the foreground from the background ( rotoscoping ) and place it in depth using software . They move stuff around and paint out the seams . Then they re - render the movie from two virtual cameras . Turns out a lot people are n't very discerning when it comes to 3d , and it 's cheaper and less hassle than using two cameras during the shoot .","Movies that are not originally filmed in 3D can be converted into 3D in post-production, which means after the movie has already been filmed and is being prepared for release. To do this, the movie is first divided into two separate images, one for the left eye and one for the right eye. These images are then slightly offset from each other to create the illusion of depth when viewed through special glasses that have one red lens and one blue lens (or one green and one magenta). 
The process of converting a 2D movie into 3D is complex and time-consuming, and it involves using computer software to analyze the images and assign different levels of depth to different objects in the frame. This allows the 3D version of the movie to have a sense of depth and perspective that makes it feel more immersive and realistic. 
So, to sum it up, movies that are not originally filmed in 3D can be made to look like they were filmed in 3D by using special computer software to create two slightly offset images and adding depth to different objects in the frame. When these images are viewed through special glasses, they create the illusion of 3D."
76,"what are the facial differences between men and women ? Just as an example here , if a head was found with no hair / eyebrows / eye lashes , how can the gender be found ? Please explain like I'm five.","Sexual Dimorphism - Some species of animals exhibit differences between sexes so that an individual of that species can fulfil they 're reproductive and survival requirements relative to they 're species . the differences can vary for different species and there is no set characteristic for males or females . i.e. in mammals ( particularly social mammals ) males tends to be larger and stronger and physically better adapted to aggression and conflict , females tend to be better suited to child rearing ( before I get hate mail of Feminazis this is biology , not sociology ) . In Insects Females tend to be larger and better suited to child rearing , where males tend to be simply used sperm production . But back to your original question , what are the facial differences between men and women ? Sexual selection seems to be one of the key factors in later human development . determine the fundamental characteristics of each sex based on the needs and requirement of the opposite sex . For example , men tend to be larger , stronger and broader shoulders ; conversely women have wider hips , are shorter and have a higher fat to muscle ratios . These Characteristics are indicative that men historically have been considered the better fighters and women he better child carers , and in purely reproductive terms would have influenced the sexual selection of either sex , in laments terms men with more masculine features are more sexually desirable , and women with more feminine features are more sexually desirable . ( generally speaking ) However these selection characteristics have also influenced other arbitrary features that we have associated with better mates . I.e. men having wider , squarer jaw lines , and females having the converse . Women having "" softer "" facial features and men having "" harder "" facial features . This is n't an exact science and I based on generalizations , which in turn are based on social perceptions . So a forensic investigator in the situation you provided would have to used assumptions to determine the difference . However I do think there are certain aspects that are absolute , like nose to eye width ratios and so on .","There are several differences between the facial features of men and women that can help to determine their gender. Here are a few examples: 
1. Men tend to have stronger and more defined jawlines, while women tend to have softer and rounder jawlines. 
2. Men tend to have thicker eyebrows, while women tend to have thinner eyebrows. 
3. Men tend to have larger noses, while women tend to have smaller noses. 
4. Men tend to have a larger distance between their eyes, while women tend to have a smaller distance between their eyes. 
If you were trying to determine the gender of a person whose head was found with no hair, eyebrows, or eye lashes, you could look at these facial features to help you make a guess. It's important to note, however, that these are generalizations and there can be overlap between the facial features of men and women. It's also possible for someone to have facial features that don't match the typical expectations for their gender, so it's important to be mindful of this when trying to determine someone's gender."
77,"How do gas stations get away with selling drug paraphernalia like bowls and grinders ? Edit : Not sure if it 's bowl or pipe , I 'm not very familiar with that kind of stuff . Sorry if I was wrong . Please explain like I'm five.","Because there 's nothing about a bowl or a grinder that 's inherently tied to illegal drug usage . You could be using them for tobacco , for all they know ! It 's the same reason head shops can exist . Until it 's coated in marijuana residue , a bowl is not necessarily paraphernalia .","It is generally not legal for gas stations to sell drug paraphernalia, which includes items like pipes, bongs, and grinders that are primarily used for consuming illegal drugs. However, some gas stations may still sell these items because they can be used for other purposes as well, such as grinding herbs for cooking or tobacco for smoking. In these cases, the gas station may argue that they are not intending for the items to be used for illegal purposes, and they are simply selling them as everyday products. 
It's worth noting that the laws regarding the sale of drug paraphernalia vary by state and country, and it's possible that some gas stations may be breaking the law by selling these items. If you have concerns about a gas station selling drug paraphernalia, you can contact your local authorities or speak to the management of the gas station."
78,why the new seasons for a tv show are typically in fall . Would n't it make sense for some shows to come out in spring or summer so that there 's less competition for viewership ? Please explain like I'm five.,"Traditionally , as school began and the weather became cooler , people were less likely to go out and more likely to stay at home watching television . A new show would reach the widest audience on a weekday evening in the fall . Premier them in the summer and half your audience is out at the beach or the park or a family cookout or on vacation , etc .","Traditionally, new seasons of TV shows have premiered in the fall because that is when the major networks (like ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox) have their ""upfronts,"" which are presentations to advertisers about the new shows that they will be airing in the upcoming television season. The upfronts usually take place in May, and the new TV seasons begin in September. This allows the networks to promote their new shows to a large audience over the summer, so that people will be more likely to watch when the new seasons begin. 
There are a few reasons why it might make sense for some shows to come out in the spring or summer instead. For one thing, there is typically less competition for viewership during these times of year, since there are fewer new shows premiering. This can be especially helpful for shows that are trying to establish a strong following and might get lost in the shuffle during the crowded fall season. Additionally, the weather is generally nicer in the spring and summer, which can make it a more appealing time for people to sit down and watch TV. 
Overall, it really depends on the show and what the creators and networks think will be the best time for it to be released. Some shows might be more successful in the fall, while others might do better in the spring or summer."
79,why do people throw up after extreme workouts ? Just curious as to why it happen . Please explain like I'm five.,"If you body is doing a lot of work , it needs all the energy it has , digesting food takes energy , so getting rid of it allows more energy to be used for task at hand . Sort of a fight or flight response .","When you exercise, your body uses up energy and can become tired. When you push yourself to do a very intense workout, your body can become overwhelmed and not be able to keep up with the physical demands you are putting on it. This can cause a number of physical symptoms, including feeling sick to your stomach and throwing up. 
Throwing up after a workout can also be a sign of overexertion, which means that you have pushed yourself too hard and your body is not able to handle the stress. Overexertion can cause your body to release certain hormones and chemicals that can make you feel sick and cause you to throw up. 
It's important to listen to your body and not push yourself too hard when you are exercising. It's okay to challenge yourself and work hard, but it's also important to take breaks and rest when you need to, and to hydrate and fuel your body properly before and after your workouts."
80,"How do firefighters determine what started a fire ? I.e. a cigarette , would n't evidence of that be burned up ? Please explain like I'm five.","When fire burns , it has different patterns and can leave a sort of "" trail "" as to which way it travels as well as whether accelerants such as oils , gasoline or kerosene were burnt in the process","Firefighters use a variety of methods to determine the cause of a fire. One of the most common methods is to look for patterns in the way the fire burned. For example, if a fire starts in one specific area and spreads outward, it may be an indication that the fire was caused by something in that area, such as an electrical problem or a candle. 
Another way that firefighters can determine the cause of a fire is by looking for clues at the scene of the fire. This might include things like a burned cigarette butt, melted electrical wiring, or other materials that may have been involved in starting the fire. 
It's important to note that sometimes it can be difficult to determine the exact cause of a fire, especially if the fire was very large or if it destroyed a lot of evidence. In these cases, firefighters may have to use a combination of different methods to figure out what happened."
81,"Are christians and muslims worshipping the same god ?

In Islam, God is believed to be a single, indivisible being with no partners or equals. Muslims believe that God revealed his will and guidance for humanity through the prophet Muhammad and the holy book of Islam, the Quran. 
Judaism also believes in one God, who is the creator and ruler of the universe. Jews believe that God revealed himself and his laws to the prophet Moses and that the Torah, the Jewish holy book, contains God's laws and teachings. 
While Christians, Muslims, and Jews all believe in the existence of one God, they have different beliefs about the nature and characteristics of God and how God has revealed himself to humanity. As a result, they may have different practices and rituals related to their faith."
82,how do country 's that operate a no tax policy operate ? Monaco for example Please explain like I'm five.,"There is no such thing . There are countries without * income * taxes , but they collect other taxes .","Countries that operate a no tax policy, like Monaco, still need to find ways to fund their governments and pay for the services they provide to their citizens. One way they can do this is by relying on other sources of income, such as tourism or the sale of goods and services. 
Monaco, for example, is a small country located on the Mediterranean coast in Europe. It is known for its luxury casinos, hotels, and high-end real estate. These industries bring in a lot of money for the government and help fund the services it provides to its citizens, such as education and healthcare. 
Another way that countries with no tax policy can fund their governments is by charging fees for certain services, such as the use of roads or the sale of licenses. These fees can provide the government with a source of income that can be used to pay for the services it provides to its citizens. 
It's important to note that while Monaco does not have a traditional tax system, it still has certain requirements for businesses and individuals living and working in the country. For example, businesses must pay fees for the right to operate in Monaco, and individuals must pay fees to live or work in the country. These fees help to fund the services provided by the government."
83,Why is white rice cheaper than brown rice ? I do n't understand why white rice is cheaper than brown rice . Is n't there more work involved in making white rice ? AND more demand for it ? Please explain like I'm five.,"Making white rice might be slightly more work , but keeping brown rice from going rancid is also more work , and that is not just a one time thing . But mostly , brown rice is trendy among affluent foodies , who are willing to pay more for it . You can get them for more or less the same price if you shop around and buy in bulk .","White rice is often cheaper than brown rice because it is more processed and has had the bran and germ removed, which are the outer layers of the rice grain. These outer layers contain most of the nutrients, fiber, and flavor of the rice, so brown rice is generally considered to be more nutritious than white rice. However, the processing of white rice is simpler and requires fewer steps, which makes it cheaper to produce. The demand for white rice is also generally higher than that for brown rice, particularly in many developing countries where it is a staple food. This higher demand can also contribute to the lower price of white rice."
84,"What is a strawman arguement ? I searched for it but it uses some technical terms that I just do n't get , so what is a strawman arguement in a nutshell ? Edit : Thanks for the responses , it 's definitely more clear now . Please explain like I'm five.","A strawman is when instead of arguing your opponents position , you make up a new position that they do not hold and fight that . Say Joe and bob are having a debate on illegal immigration . joe : I believe we should build a large inpenetrable fence around our borders so no illegal immigrants can come in . bob : so you believe immigrants should be rounded up and put behind fences like some sort of concentration camp ? here , bob made a strawman because nowhere in his argument did joe mention that he wanted people rounded up or placed in a concentration camp .","A strawman argument is a type of argument where someone misrepresents or misunderstands someone else's position, and then attacks this misrepresented position instead of the real position. It's like building a straw man (a dummy made of straw) to knock down, instead of fighting the real person. 
Here's an example: 
Person A: ""I think we should recycle more because it helps the environment.""
Person B: ""But you just want to force everyone to do things your way and take away our freedom."" 
Person B's argument is a strawman, because they misunderstood or misrepresented Person A's position. Person A never said anything about taking away freedom, they just said they think recycling is good for the environment. Person B's argument attacks this misrepresented position, instead of the real position. 
In other words, a strawman argument is when someone sets up a ""dummy"" version of someone else's argument and then attacks that, instead of the real argument. It's a way of avoiding a real discussion or debate by attacking a position that the other person doesn't actually hold."

The countdown does n't just go from ten seconds - NASA 's countdown clock starts at 43 hours , but there 's not somebody announcing ever second apart from at the very end !","Countdown to liftoff is a sequence of events that occurs before a rocket is launched. It helps to ensure that everything is ready for the launch and that all the necessary checks have been completed. 
There are many different steps that need to be done before a rocket can be launched, and the countdown helps to ensure that everything is done in the right order. For example, the countdown may include checks of the rocket's systems, fueling the rocket, and making sure that all the people and equipment are in the right place. 
The countdown also helps to build excitement and anticipation for the launch. It's like a countdown before a big event, like a sports game or a fireworks show. It helps to build suspense and excitement for the main event. 
So, in short, the countdown to liftoff serves both practical and emotional purposes. It helps to ensure that everything is ready for the launch and also helps to build excitement and anticipation for the event."
86,Why do multistory office buildings and skyscraper like buildings keep their lights on all the time ? Can someone explain why we are n't saving tons of money by cutting these damn office lights off at night ? Please explain like I'm five.,"Because work goes on virtually every hour of every day in high rises . The office critters occupy and push papers and make up money during the daylight and sometimes into the evening . And Overnight / early morning there are cleaning crews maintenance / repair crews and construction crews and security people wandering about . The tenants in highrise office buildings are constantly changing , whenever a new tenant moves into a floor or subdivides a floor into multiple offices the work on the build out ca n't happen during the day since office critters would get upset if construction men were walking all over their desks and shifting stuff around while they were there . My company occasionally does high rise tenant finish and when the tenant wants a new break room or two , and the executive wants a private bathroom in his corner office then things need to be happening on multiple floors at once . The drainage piping needs to be run on the floor below , which is likely occupied . To install new drainage plumbing in a high rise a large X - ray machine needs to be brought out and shoot beams of radiation up towards the slab to find what locations are available for drilling , ( this needs to be done from the floor below ) then we bring out large core drills which make lots of noise and spray mud everywhere , which requires us to cover all the office folks computers and desks / cabinets and family photos with tarps so when they get back in the morning they do n't know we were romping around their office the previous night . Then we need to take the ceiling grid panels out from the occupied floor and bring in the equipment to install the new piping . Doing any of this during ' working hours ' , everything from bringing in large radiation machines and blasting them between their desks , to covering everyone with tarps and spraying them with mud which making a racket , would piss loads of workers off . Work like what I 'm describing will mean that three floors are completely lit up for the entire night shift , if it 's a 35 story building and 2 - 3 floors are being re - finished and there are two cleaning crews and a security / maintenance crew going around as well then that would mean 10 - 12 floors at a time minimum are lit up so people are able to work . Tl , DR : If the lights are on on a certain floor of a highrise , there are people doing some form of work on that floor , if there are no lights or the lights are dim then the floor is unoccupied at that time . I 've also heard rumors that tall buildings need to keep a certain amount of floors lit up so aeroplanes can see then easier and gauge their height / distance at night . Though I think this is less likely than work going on , tall buildings have those flashing red lights up top for planes .","There are a few reasons why office buildings and skyscrapers might keep their lights on at night: 
1. Safety: One reason is for safety purposes. Keeping the lights on can help people navigate the building and find their way around, especially in case of an emergency. 
2. Security: Another reason is for security. Having the lights on can deter burglars and vandals, and also help security personnel keep an eye on the building. 
3. Convenience: Some people might be working late or overnight in the building, and they might need the lights on to do their work. 
4. Energy efficiency: In some cases, the lights in office buildings and skyscrapers might be designed to be energy efficient, so they don't use as much energy as you might think. Additionally, turning the lights off and on frequently can actually use more energy than leaving them on, because it takes energy to start up the lighting system each time it is turned on. 
5. Cost: Finally, it might be more expensive to turn the lights off and on all the time than to just leave them on. This is because each time the lights are turned on and off, it causes wear and tear on the lighting system, which can shorten its lifespan and increase maintenance costs. 
Overall, there are a number of factors to consider when deciding whether to keep the lights on in an office building or skyscraper, and it's not always as simple as just turning them off to save money."
87,If a death row inmate killed a guard on the day of their execution would it get delayed so they could stand trial for this crime ? Asks a death row inmate . Please explain like I'm five.,"Not for a trial but delayed for an investigation . If someone was able to do that , no further executions would take place until measures were put in place to prevent it from happening again .","It is possible that the execution of a death row inmate who committed a crime, such as killing a guard, on the day of their execution could be delayed so that they can stand trial for the additional crime. This is because everyone, including death row inmates, has the right to a fair and legal process. 
If the inmate is accused of committing a crime, they have the right to a fair trial where they can present their defense and have their case heard by a judge or jury. This means that they would need to have the opportunity to have an attorney represent them, to present evidence and witness testimony, and to have their case decided upon by a fair and impartial decision-maker. 
It is also important to note that the legal process can take time, and it may be necessary to delay the execution in order to ensure that the inmate has the opportunity to have their case heard and decided upon fairly."
88,Why there is more inequality in the US when we have such a progressive tax system URL_0 Please explain like I'm five.,"[ Here ] ( URL_0 ) , read one of the author 's other blog entries . He basically goes over some the details there . In short , though , a progressive tax system is n't enough on its own to reduce income inequality because tax only ' takes ' money . It has to be followed up by a progressive spending system that helps put money effectively towards helping the lower income brackets . Also , in the US , most of the top earners make the majority of their money through investment , dividends , and capital gains , some of which are taxed at a much lower rate than standard income tax . Editted for some corrections because I 'm not an American so I do n't know your tax code completely off - hand .","Progressive taxation is a system in which people who earn more money pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes than people who earn less money. In the United States, the progressive tax system is designed to reduce income inequality by taking a larger percentage of income from people who are more able to pay, and using that money to fund programs and services that benefit the entire population, such as education, healthcare, and social security. 
However, there are still many factors that can contribute to inequality in the United States, even with a progressive tax system in place. For example, some people may have access to better education and job opportunities, which can lead to higher incomes. Additionally, there may be systemic biases and discrimination that make it more difficult for certain groups of people to advance in their careers or earn as much as others. 
Finally, the overall distribution of wealth in a society, rather than just income, also plays a role in inequality. Wealth, or the total value of a person's assets (such as their savings, investments, and property), can be passed down from generation to generation, which can create a more unequal distribution of resources over time. 
Overall, while a progressive tax system can help to reduce inequality, it is just one factor among many that contribute to the overall level of inequality in a society."
89,"How does a star ( such as sol ) work ? They are just floating balls of energy , how do they just not explode or collapse on themselves ? please go to into detail Please explain like I'm five.","A star is an immense ball of gas , mostly hydrogen and helium . The gravitational pull draws the gasses towards the center of the star . This creates incredible pressure . The pressure causes nuclear fusion , which fuses hydrogen atoms into helium , releasing a lot of energy in the process . This energy pushes outwards , working against the gravitational pull and preventing the star from collapsing inwards .","Stars, like our own Sun, are made up of very hot gases, mostly hydrogen and helium. They give off energy in the form of light and heat, which is what we feel here on Earth as sunlight. 
Stars are able to stay in balance and not explode or collapse because of something called nuclear fusion. This is a process that happens in the center of the star, where the temperature and pressure are extremely high. In nuclear fusion, the hydrogen atoms combine to form helium atoms, and this releases a huge amount of energy in the form of light and heat. 
This energy helps to hold the star up and keep it from collapsing in on itself. The energy from nuclear fusion also helps to push outwards against the weight of the outer layers of the star, which would otherwise cause the star to collapse. 
In short, the energy produced by nuclear fusion helps to balance the forces acting on a star and keeps it from collapsing or exploding."
90,"Why does scratching my back relieve an itch but having someone else scratch it make it damn near orgasmic ? It 's just one of the best experiences of human contact , to me . Please explain like I'm five.","When any part of our body is touched , nerves in the skin are activated . On the way to the brain , those nerves meet at several junctions or ' gates ' . At those junctions , bunches of nerves coming from nearby all gather together on the way to the brain At each gate , the signals from all the bundled nerves are processed together . Sometimes , two nerves work together to increase each other 's intensity , and sometimes , they dampen each other 's signals . At the same time , nerves coming from the brain work as ' central control ' to change the intensity of the signal that 's being passed on . Again , sometimes the signal is increased , and sometimes it 's decreased . Over the history of their development , our brains have gotten good at learning what signals they should pay attention to , and what signals they can ignore . One of the signals the brain has learned to ' ignore ' is self touch . It is n't dangerous , and we usually only need to be partially aware of it . Walking through a spider web and touching your hand to your face are two different experiences , and for good reason . When the brain identifies self - touch , it uses those feedback fibers I mentioned before to suppress the intensity of sensation , which makes it easier to ignore . Also , when a signal arrives in the brain , several regions cooperate to figure out exactly what it is , where it came from , and what to do about it . When we identify self - touch , there are regions of our brain that are trained to say ' ignore it ' . As a result , we suppress the intensity of those signals .","When you scratch your own back, you are applying pressure to the skin and nerves in that area, which can help to relieve the sensation of an itch. When someone else scratches your back, the sensation may be even more pleasurable because it combines the physical sensation of the scratching with the emotional pleasure of being touched by someone else. It's also possible that having someone else scratch your back may allow you to scratch in areas that are difficult to reach on your own, which could further increase the pleasure of the experience. Ultimately, the pleasure of having someone else scratch your back is likely due to a combination of physical and emotional factors."

Please explain like I'm five.","Ocean provides much better margins of error , and the navy , the folk that actually have to go pick them up , are far more suited to getting out on the open seas rather than shimmying through the canals to get up the St Lawrence and through the lakes . Also the capsule , ideally , is only facing salt water on the exterior . That 's the heat shield and vacuum shield , it 's dealt with far worse .","Landing a spacecraft in a lake would not be a safe or practical way to return to Earth. Here are a few reasons why: 
1. Density: Water is much denser than air, so when a spacecraft falls into it from a high altitude, it will experience much more resistance and deceleration. This could cause the spacecraft to break apart or sustain serious damage upon impact. 
2. Depth: Lakes are typically not very deep, so if a spacecraft were to land in one, it would have to do so at a very low altitude. This would not give the spacecraft enough time to slow down and make a safe landing. 
3. Control: When a spacecraft returns to Earth, it needs to be able to control its descent and land in a specific location. This is not possible when landing in a lake, as the spacecraft would be at the mercy of the wind and currents. 
4. Recovery: Finally, it would be very difficult to recover a spacecraft that has landed in a lake. Specialized equipment would be needed to lift it out of the water, which could be time-consuming and costly. 
In summary, landing a spacecraft in a lake is not a safe or practical option. Instead, spacecraft are designed to land on solid ground, where they can touch down at a controlled speed and be easily recovered."
92,"What is a person 's net worth ? Does it have to do with how much money they have or what potential they have to earn more , or maybe a combination ? Also , who decides ? Please explain like I'm five.","A person 's net worth is the value of all their assets , minus debts .","A person's net worth is a measure of how much wealth they have. It's the total value of all the things they own, minus any debts or liabilities they have. 
To calculate a person's net worth, you would add up the value of all their assets, such as their house, car, savings accounts, stocks, and other investments. Then, you would subtract any debts or liabilities they have, such as credit card balances, student loans, or mortgages. The result is their net worth. 
For example, if a person has $100,000 in savings, a house worth $300,000, and no debts, their net worth would be $400,000. On the other hand, if that same person had $100,000 in savings, a house worth $300,000, and a mortgage of $200,000, their net worth would be $200,000 (since they would be subtracting the $200,000 mortgage from their total assets of $400,000). 
Net worth is usually calculated by a person themselves, or by a financial advisor or accountant. It can be a useful way to track a person's financial progress over time and see how much wealth they have built up. 
It's important to note that net worth is different from income, which is the money a person earns from working or investing. A person's net worth reflects their overall financial situation, while their income is just one part of it."
93,Can US ever repay its national debt ? Is it possible to ever get the 17 or so trillion dollar debt back to 0 and how so ? Please explain like I'm five.,"I think it goes without saying that government is n't really anything like personal debt but it might help put things in perspective using a more familiar idea we can grasp . Part of the problem with the perception of our debt being a big problem is that the numbers are big . Mind bogglingly big . Scary big . Our debt is roughly $ 17,000,000,000,000 . And , yes , that is a big number . But let me show you another number : $ 17,000,000,000,000 . Why , yes . That is the same number . $ 17,000,000,000,000 also happens to be our Gross Domestic Product or GDP , which is what our country produces in a year . Think of the GDP as our annual salary as a country . Now if you met a person who made $ 170,000 a year ( a much easier number to get your head around ) and that person was in debt to the tune of $ 170,000 say with a house a couple of credit cards and that person always paid all of his bills all the time , most people would say that person has very good credit and is n't at risk of going bankrupt and would likely be a particularly good candidate if they decided to get another loan . And so long as their income grows proportionally with their debt and they keep paying their bills , they 'll continue to be a safe bet to continue to receive loans . In other words , if their debt rose to $ 200,000 , that 'd be okay if their income was also in the neighborhood of $ 200,000 . Now what you want to know is : Can the debt ever be repaid ? And the simple answer is , "" yes , but you would n't really want to "" . Keeping our house metaphor in tact for the time being , if we wanted to get out of debt , we could pay less for the stuff we use and use the difference to pay down our debt . But there 's a problem : What do we cut ? Food ? Medicine ? Clothing ? Home Security ? Everything we 're spending money on we more or less need . Sure , we could nibble around the edges and find a few dollars here and there , but not enough to make a really big difference . Going back to our full scale US debt , it sounds good to say you 're going to cut our $ 10 million budget for ketchup research or $ 6 million in pork for a courthouse in Milwaukee , but that 's like saying you 're going to pay off your mortgage by rummaging around for spare change in your couch . When trillions are on the table , millions wo n't cut it and billions will barely touch it . Which is n't to say it 's impossible . Just about 20 years ago the Clinton administration had a plan to pay down the national debt by raising taxes and cutting spending . According to that plan , we would have paid off the national debt by the far off future year of 2011 . Unfortunately , when we went to war in Afghanistan and Iraq in 2002 and 2003 , that added expense sidelined the debt repayment and ballooned our debt . And then in 2008 and 2009 the financial crisis happened and various stimulus packages and tax relief packages meant our debt ballooned again . It 's really been a lousy decade for debt and deficit . But have no fear : Should we do the obvious yet politically suicidal thing of raising taxes and cutting spending we can get our debt under control again ( until the next big crisis , at least ) . But we do n't want to pay it off , mostly because a lot of our debt is n't owned by foreign countries : it 's owned by people like you and me in the form of government bonds . ( Basically you buy XX in IOUs from the government and they 'll pay you back XX plus interest after a given amount of time and these are generally seen as safe but low(er ) return parts of many investment portfolios for individuals and businesses . ) If the government is debt free , that means there are no bonds to invest in , which is n't very good for the economy . Economists might disagree on how much debt is good and how much is bad but most would agree that it 's best to have some . So that it . Our debt is big , but it 's not concerning because it 's about the same size as our GDP . It should probably be at least a little smaller , which is simple and hard because everyone knows what needs to be done ( higher taxes and lower spending ) but nobody is willing to do it . But much like needing to lose weight you ca n't just exercise more OR cut calories , you 've got to do both . And while we could one day , 20 , 30 years from now slowly get to zero with modest cuts and tax hikes , we do n't really need to or want to because it would mean lower , slower economic growth as a nation and fewer quality investment opportunities for individuals and businesses .","The United States national debt is the total amount of money that the federal government owes to its creditors. The debt is currently about $28 trillion and it is possible for it to be repaid, but it would require the government to make regular payments to its creditors to reduce the balance. 
There are a few ways that the government could make these payments: 
1. By running budget surpluses: This means that the government would bring in more money through taxes and other revenues than it spends on things like defense, education, and healthcare. The extra money could be used to pay down the debt. 
2. By selling assets: The government could sell things like land, buildings, or other assets to raise money to pay off the debt. 
3. By growing the economy: If the economy grows, the government will bring in more money through taxes, which could be used to pay down the debt. 
It is important to note that the national debt is not necessarily a bad thing. In fact, it can be a useful tool for the government to fund important projects and stimulate the economy. However, if the debt gets too large, it can become difficult for the government to make the necessary payments, which could lead to financial problems."
94,Why is it 1366x768 that became such a common laptop screen resolution ? Is there any particular reason ? Please explain like I'm five.,"1024x768 was a standard resolution for square aspect ratio monitors , so the 768 presumably comes from keeping that consistent and easily manufacturable . The 1366 is just brought about from the aspect ratio of widescreen 16:9 . Since DVDs were often widescreen it became a standard choice . There was a phase of 16:10 monitors for computers , mine for instance is 1680x1050 , but mass production wins out and the decision to use the same resolution across TVs , laptops and monitors drove the price down . That in turn meant other designers went with the lower cost screen ... becoming standard .","The 1366x768 screen resolution became common on laptops because it is a good balance between image quality and the amount of processing power that is needed to display an image at that resolution. It is a common resolution for laptops because it provides enough detail for most tasks, such as web browsing and document editing, without requiring a lot of processing power. This means that laptops with 1366x768 screens can be more energy efficient, which is important for devices that are often used on the go. Additionally, 1366x768 is a common resolution for LCD panels, which are used in many laptop displays, so it is often easier and more cost-effective for manufacturers to use this resolution."
95,How come the Constitution of the US is relevant in modern cases even though it was created on 1787 ? How come it is used in very modern cases ( mostly technology related ) when such things did n't exist back then ? Please explain like I'm five.,"The Constitution is the highest law of the land in the U.S. It can be amended - such as the thirteenth amendment which abolished slavery , for example - but you ca n't make a law which ignores or contradicts the Constitution without Congress passing a constitutional amendment . You also ca n't make laws which ignore or contradict previous constitutional amendments .","The Constitution of the United States is the supreme law of the United States. It was created in 1787 and has been amended a few times since then. Even though it was created a long time ago, it is still relevant today because it sets out the basic principles and structure of the government and protects certain fundamental rights of the people. These principles and rights are still important today, even though technology and society have changed a lot since the Constitution was written. 
For example, the Constitution guarantees freedom of speech, religion, and the press. These rights are important no matter what technology is being used, because they protect the ability of people to express their ideas and beliefs without fear of punishment. 
The Constitution also sets out the powers of the different branches of government, such as the legislative, executive, and judicial branches. These powers are still important today, because they help to ensure that the government is accountable to the people and that no one branch of government becomes too powerful. 
So even though the Constitution was written a long time ago, it is still very relevant today because it sets out the basic principles and structure of the government and protects important rights of the people."
96,Why does Valve have Greenlight would n't it make money whether or not people liked the game ? Thanks Please explain like I'm five.,"Now , There are 2 problems with steam , and both fixes by valve were , um ... Not . - Getting the game on steam was ... luck ? magic ? no - one knew how it worked or why , but unless you were being published by the likes of EA or Ubisoft , getting your game on steam was impossible . this basicly culled out indies . So they added greenlight as a sort of popularity system . It got abused ( suprise ! ) and so they went back to the drawing board . Thus they added Early Access . ( which seems to work more or less ) but they never removed greenlight - which they stated they were planning on removing . so we 'll see when that happens . Lastly , they then opened the gates to publishes of all kinds to push their back - log catelogue ( ie : their bargain bin shit ) to steam . Which resulted in steam having to redesign their frontpage . which took them 6 months . yay valve ?","Valve, the company that developed the Steam platform, created a system called Greenlight as a way for developers to get their games on Steam, which is a digital distribution platform for video games. Greenlight was a way for the community to vote on which games they wanted to see on Steam. 
In order for a game to be released on Steam, it had to go through the Greenlight process. Developers would submit their game to Greenlight and the community could then vote on whether or not they wanted to see the game on Steam. If a game received enough votes, it would be approved and released on Steam. 
Valve created Greenlight as a way to get more games on Steam and to involve the community in the process of deciding which games should be released. It also gave smaller developers a chance to get their games on Steam even if they didn't have a publisher or a big marketing budget. 
Overall, the goal of Greenlight was to help Valve make more money by getting more games on Steam and increasing the number of people using the platform."
97,"why do people so commonly say SO instead of boyfriend or girlfriend ? I understand what it means , but it just sounds so formal and impersonal to me . Please explain like I'm five.","SO covers boyfriends , girlfriends , husbands , wives , casual dating , and does so without being gender or status specific .","People might use the term ""SO"" instead of ""boyfriend"" or ""girlfriend"" because it can be a more casual and informal way of referring to their romantic partner. It can also be a way of not disclosing too much personal information about their relationship to others. 
For example, if someone is talking to a friend and they don't want to share the details of their relationship with that person, they might use the term ""SO"" to refer to their partner. This allows them to talk about their partner without using specific terms that might reveal more about the nature of their relationship. 
In general, people use different terms to refer to their romantic partners depending on their personal preferences and the context in which they are speaking. Some people might prefer more formal terms, while others might prefer more casual or informal terms."
98,"How do companies that buy & re - sell other people 's debt make money ? Say , a call center is open specifically to buy and sell debt . Please explain like I'm five.","I get that they are "" bottom feeders "" but to be fair if someone does n't repay their debts ( of at least the principle amount ) they ultimately stole that money . Thanks in advance for the downvotes ;)","When a company or individual owes money to another company or individual, that debt is known as a ""credit obligation."" Sometimes, the company or individual who is owed money may not have the resources or the desire to try to collect the debt themselves. In these cases, they may decide to sell the debt to another company. 
The company that buys the debt is usually hoping to make a profit by collecting the debt from the person or company who owes it. They do this by contacting the debtor and trying to get them to pay the debt. If they are successful in getting the debtor to pay, then the company that bought the debt makes a profit. 
Here's an example: 
Company A sells a product to Company B for $100.
Company B doesn't pay Company A for the product.
Company A decides it doesn't want to try to collect the debt, so it sells the debt to Company C for $50.
Company C contacts Company B and tries to get them to pay the debt.
If Company B agrees to pay the debt, then Company C will have made a profit of $50 ($100 - $50 = $50). 
So, in short, companies that buy and re-sell debt make money by collecting the debts that they have purchased and keeping the difference between the amount they paid for the debt and the amount they were able to collect."
99,"What is Heisenberg 's uncertainty principle in layman 's terms ? EDIT : Past the basics i.e. "" The more we know about something 's speed , the less we know about its location . "" Please explain like I'm five.","In the simplest terms , anything we do to try and detect the location of a particle will change its speed . In the same way , anything we do to try and measure its speed will change its location . It 's a matter of measurement and sensing sciences , which we can not ( at least yet ) surmount . Heisenberg 's theory is that it is impossible to know both at once .","Heisenberg's uncertainty principle is a fundamental idea in quantum mechanics, which is a theory that describes how very small things (like atoms and subatomic particles) behave. According to the uncertainty principle, it is impossible to know both the exact position and the exact momentum (speed and direction) of a particle at the same time. 
This might seem strange, but imagine trying to measure the position of a small insect flying around a room. If you want to know exactly where the insect is, you might try to shine a flashlight on it. But as soon as you shine the light on the insect, you change its momentum (because the light has energy, and when it hits the insect it gives some of that energy to the insect). So now you know where the insect is, but you don't know its momentum as well as you did before. On the other hand, if you don't shine any light on the insect, you might be able to figure out its momentum (for example, by clapping your hands and trying to chase it), but now you don't know its position as well as you did before. 
The uncertainty principle tells us that there is always a trade-off between knowing the position and knowing the momentum of a particle. The more precisely we know one of these things, the less precisely we can know the other. This is a fundamental aspect of the nature of the universe at very small scales, and it has important implications for how we understand the world around us."
